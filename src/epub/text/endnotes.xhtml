					<p>The <i>Divine Comedy</i>.—The <i>Vita Nuova</i> of Dante closes with these words: “After this sonnet there appeared to me a wonderful vision, in which I beheld things that made me propose to say no more of this blessed one, until I shall be able to treat of her more worthily. And to attain thereunto, truly I strive with all my power, as she knoweth. So that if it shall be the pleasure of Him, through whom all things live, that my life continue somewhat longer, I hope to say of her what never yet was said of any woman. And then may it please Him, who is the Sire of courtesy, that my soul may depart to look upon the glory of its Lady, that is to say, of the blessed Beatrice, who in glory gazes into the face of Him, <i>qui est per omnia sacula benedictus</i>.”</p>
					<p>In these lines we have the earliest glimpse of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, as it rose in the author's mind.</p>
					<p>Whoever has read the <i>Vita Nuova</i> will remember the stress which Dante lays upon the mystic numbers Nine and Three; his first meeting with Beatrice at the beginning of her ninth year, and the end of his; his nine days’ illness, and the thought of her death which came to him on the ninth dav; her death on the ninth day of the ninth month, “computing by the Syrian method,” and in that year of our Lord “when the perfect number ten was nine times completed in that century” which was the thirteenth. Moreover, he says the number nine was friendly to her, because the nine heavens were in conjunction at her birth; and that she was herself the number nine, “that is, a miracle whose root is the wonderful Trinity.”</p>
					<p>Following out this idea, we find the <i>Divine Comedy</i> written in <i>terza rima</i>, or threefold rhyme, divided into three parts, and each part again subdivided in its structure into three. The whole number of cantos is one hundred, the perfect number ten multiplied into itself; but if we count the first canto of the Inferno as a Prelude, which it really is, each part will consist of thirtythree cantos, making ninety-nine in all; and so the favorite mystic numbers reappear.</p>
					<p>The three divisions of the Inferno are minutely described and explained by Dante in Canto XI. They are separated from each other by great spaces in the infernal abyss. The sins punished in them are— <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> Incontinence. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> Malice. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> Bestiality.</p>
					<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <b>Incontinence</b>: 1. The Wanton. 2. The Gluttonous. 3. The Avaricious and Prodigal. 4. The Irascible and the Sullen.</p>
					<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> <b>Malice</b>: 1. The Violent against their neighbor, in person or property. 2. The Violent against themselves, in person or property. 3. The Violent against God, or against Nature, the daughter of God, or against Art, the daughter of Nature.</p>
					<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> <b>Bestiality</b>: first subdivision: 1. Seducers. 2. Flatterers. 3. Simoniacs. 4. Soothsayers. 5. Barrators. 6. Hypocrites. 7. Thieves. 8. Evil counsellors. 9. Schismatics. 10. Falsifiers.</p>
					<p>Second subdivision: 1. Traitors to their kindred. 2. Traitors to their country. 3. Traitors to their friends. 4. Traitors to their lords and benefactors.</p>
					<p>The <i>Divine Comedy</i> is not strictly an allegorical poem in the sense in which the <i>Faerie Queene</i> is; and yet it is full of allegorical symbols and figurative meanings. In a letter to Can Grande della Scala, Dante writes: “It is to be remarked, that the sense of this work is not simple, but on the contrary one may say manifold. For one sense is that which is derived from the letter, and another is that which is derived from the things signified by the letter. The first is called literal, the second allegorical or moral… The subject, then, of the whole work, taken literally, is the condition of souls after death, simply considered. For on this and around this the whole action of the work turns. But if the work be taken allegorically, the subject is man, how by actions of merit or demerit, through freedom of the will, he justly deserves reward or punishment.”</p>
					<p>It may not be amiss here to refer to what are sometimes called the sources of the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Foremost among them must be placed the Eleventh Book of the <i>Odyssey</i>, and the Sixth of the <i>Aeneid</i>; and to the latter Dante seems to point significantly in choosing Virgil for his Guide, his Master, his Author, from whom he took “the beautiful style that did him honor.”</p>
					<p>Next to these may be mentioned Cicero's <i>Vision of Scipio</i>, of which Chaucer says:—</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>“Chapiters seven it had, of Heven, and Hell,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And Earthe,and soules that therein do dwell.”</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Then follow the popular legends which were current in Dante's age; an age when the end of all things was thought to be near at hand, and the wonders of the invisible world had laid fast hold on the imaginations of men. Prominent among these is the “Vision of Frate Alberico,” who calls himself “the humblest servant of the servants of the Lord;” and who</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>“Saw in dreame at point-devyse</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Heaven, Earthe, Hell, and Paradyse.”</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>This vision was written in Latin in the latter half of the twelfth century, and contains a description of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, with its Seven Heavens. It is for the most part a tedious tale, and bears evident marks of having been written by a friar of some monastery, when the afternoon sun was shining into his sleepy eyes. He seems, however, to have looked upon his own work with a not unfavorable opinion; for he concludes the Epistle Introductory with the words of St. John: “If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book; and if any man shall take away from these things, God shall take away his part from the good things written in this book.”</p>
					<p>It is not impossible that Dante may have taken a few hints also from the <i>Tesoretto</i> of his teacher, Ser Brunetto Latini, See Canto XIV. Note 30.</p>

					<p>1. The action of the poem begins on Good Friday of the year 1300, at which time Dante, who was born in 1265, had reached the middle of the Scriptural threescore years and ten.

					<p>13. Bunvan, in his <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, which is a kind of <i>Divine Comedy</i> in prose, says: “I beheld then that they all went on till they came to the foot of the hill Difficulty But the narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the going up the side of the hill is called Difficulty… They went then till they came to the Delectable Mountains, which mountains belong to the Lord of that hill of which we have spoken before.” <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Then did Christian begin to be afraid, and to cast in his mind whether to go back or stand his ground… Now at the end of this valley was another, called the valley of the Shadow of Death; and Christian must needs go through it, because the way to the Celestial City lay through the midst of it." <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>60. Dante as a Ghibelline and Imperialist is in opposition to the Guelfs, Pope Boniface VIII, and the King of France, Philip the Fair, and is banished from Florence, out of the sunshine, and into “the dry wind that blows from dolorous poverty.” Cato speaks of the “silent moon” in <i>De Re Rustica</i>, XXIX, <i>Evehito luna silenti</i>; and XL, <i>Vites inseri luna silenti</i>. Also Pliny, XVI 39, has <i>Silens luna</i>; and Milton, in <i>Samson Agonistes</i> “Silent as the moon.” <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>79. In this passage Dante but expresses the universal veneration felt for Virgil during the Middle Ages, and especially in Italy. Petrarch’s copy of Virgil is still preserved in the Ambrosian Library at Milan; and at the beginning of it he has recorded in a Latin note the time of his first meeting with Laura, and the date oi her death, which, he says, "I write in this book, rather than elsewhere, because it comes often under my eye."</p>
					<p>In the popular imagination Virgil became a mythical personage and a mighty magician. See the story of <i>Virgilius</i> in Thom’s <i>Early Prose Romances</i>, 11. Dante selects him for his guide, as symbolizing human science or Philosophy. "I say and affirm," he remarks, <i>Convito</i>, V. 16, "that the lady with whom I became enamored after my first love was the most beautiful and modest daughter of the Emperor of the Universe, to whom Pythagoras gave the name of Philosophy." <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>101. The greyhound is Can Grande della Scala, Lord of Verona, Imperial Vicar, Ghibelline, and friend of Dante. Verona is between Feltro in the Marca Trivigiana, and Montefeltro in Romagna. Boccaccio, <i>Decameron</i>, I. 7, speaks of him as "one of the most notable and magnificent lords that had been known in Italy, since the Emperor Frederick the Second." To him Dante dedicated the <i>Paradiso</i>. Some commentators think the <i>Veltro</i> is not Can Grande, but Ugguccione della Faggiola.
