			<h2>Paradiso</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto I</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">The glory of Him who moveth everything<br/>
			Doth penetrate the universe, and shine<br/>
			In one part more and in another less.</p>
			<p>Within that heaven which most his light receives<br/>
			Was I, and things beheld which to repeat<br/>
			Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;</p>
			<p>Because in drawing near to its desire<br/>
			Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,<br/>
			That after it the memory cannot go.</p>
			<p>Truly whatever of the holy realm<br/>
			I had the power to treasure in my mind<br/>
			Shall now become the subject of my song.</p>
			<p>O good Apollo, for this last emprise<br/>
			Make of me such a vessel of thy power<br/>
			As giving the beloved laurel asks!</p>
			<p>One summit of Parnassus hitherto<br/>
			Has been enough for me, but now with both<br/>
			I needs must enter the arena left.</p>
			<p>Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe<br/>
			As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw<br/>
			Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.</p>
			<p>O power divine, lend'st thou thyself to me<br/>
			So that the shadow of the blessed realm<br/>
			Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,</p>
			<p>Thou'lt see me come unto thy darling tree,<br/>
			And crown myself thereafter with those leaves<br/>
			Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.</p>
			<p>So seldom, Father, do we gather them<br/>
			For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,<br/>
			(The fault and shame of human inclinations,)</p>
			<p>That the Peneian foliage should bring forth<br/>
			Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,<br/>
			When any one it makes to thirst for it.</p>
			<p>A little spark is followed by great flame;<br/>
			Perchance with better voices after me<br/>
			Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!</p>
			<p>To mortal men by passages diverse<br/>
			Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one<br/>
			Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,</p>
			<p>With better course and with a better star<br/>
			Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax<br/>
			Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.</p>
			<p>Almost that passage had made morning there<br/>
			And evening here, and there was wholly white<br/>
			That hemisphere, and black the other part,</p>
			<p>When Beatrice towards the left-hand side<br/>
			I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;<br/>
			Never did eagle fasten so upon it!</p>
			<p>And even as a second ray is wont<br/>
			To issue from the first and reascend,<br/>
			Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,</p>
			<p>Thus of her action, through the eyes infused<br/>
			In my imagination, mine I made,<br/>
			And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.</p>
			<p>There much is lawful which is here unlawful<br/>
			Unto our powers, by virtue of the place<br/>
			Made for the human species as its own.</p>
			<p>Not long I bore it, nor so little while<br/>
			But I beheld it sparkle round about<br/>
			Like iron that comes molten from the fire;</p>
			<p>And suddenly it seemed that day to day<br/>
			Was added, as if He who has the power<br/>
			Had with another sun the heaven adorned.</p>
			<p>With eyes upon the everlasting wheels<br/>
			Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her<br/>
			Fixing my vision from above removed,</p>
			<p>Such at her aspect inwardly became<br/>
			As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him<br/>
			Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.</p>
			<p>To represent transhumanise in words<br/>
			Impossible were; the example, then, suffice<br/>
			Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.</p>
			<p>If I was merely what of me thou newly<br/>
			Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,<br/>
			Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!</p>
			<p>When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal<br/>
			Desiring thee, made me attentive to it<br/>
			By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,</p>
			<p>Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled<br/>
			By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river<br/>
			E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad.</p>
			<p>The newness of the sound and the great light<br/>
			Kindled in me a longing for their cause,<br/>
			Never before with such acuteness felt;</p>
			<p>Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,<br/>
			To quiet in me my perturbed mind,<br/>
			Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,</p>
			<p>And she began: "Thou makest thyself so dull<br/>
			With false imagining, that thou seest not<br/>
			What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.</p>
			<p>Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;<br/>
			But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,<br/>
			Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest."</p>
			<p>If of my former doubt I was divested<br/>
			By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,<br/>
			I in a new one was the more ensnared;</p>
			<p>And said: "Already did I rest content<br/>
			From great amazement; but am now amazed<br/>
			In what way I transcend these bodies light."</p>
			<p>Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,<br/>
			Her eyes directed tow'rds me with that look<br/>
			A mother casts on a delirious child;</p>
			<p>And she began: "All things whate'er they be<br/>
			Have order among themselves, and this is form,<br/>
			That makes the universe resemble God.</p>
			<p>Here do the higher creatures see the footprints<br/>
			Of the Eternal Power, which is the end<br/>
			Whereto is made the law already mentioned.</p>
			<p>In the order that I speak of are inclined<br/>
			All natures, by their destinies diverse,<br/>
			More or less near unto their origin;</p>
			<p>Hence they move onward unto ports diverse<br/>
			O'er the great sea of being; and each one<br/>
			With instinct given it which bears it on.</p>
			<p>This bears away the fire towards the moon;<br/>
			This is in mortal hearts the motive power<br/>
			This binds together and unites the earth.</p>
			<p>Nor only the created things that are<br/>
			Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,<br/>
			But those that have both intellect and love.</p>
			<p>The Providence that regulates all this<br/>
			Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,<br/>
			Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.</p>
			<p>And thither now, as to a site decreed,<br/>
			Bears us away the virtue of that cord<br/>
			Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.</p>
			<p>True is it, that as oftentimes the form<br/>
			Accords not with the intention of the art,<br/>
			Because in answering is matter deaf,</p>
			<p>So likewise from this course doth deviate<br/>
			Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,<br/>
			Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,</p>
			<p>(In the same wise as one may see the fire<br/>
			Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus<br/>
			Earthward is wrested by some false delight.</p>
			<p>Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,<br/>
			At thine ascent, than at a rivulet<br/>
			From some high mount descending to the lowland.</p>
			<p>Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived<br/>
			Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,<br/>
			As if on earth the living fire were quiet."</p>
			<p>Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto II</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,<br/>
			Eager to listen, have been following<br/>
			Behind my ship, that singing sails along,</p>
			<p>Turn back to look again upon your shores;<br/>
			Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,<br/>
			In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.</p>
			<p>The sea I sail has never yet been passed;<br/>
			Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,<br/>
			And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.</p>
			<p>Ye other few who have the neck uplifted<br/>
			Betimes to th' bread of Angels upon which<br/>
			One liveth here and grows not sated by it,</p>
			<p>Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea<br/>
			Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you<br/>
			Upon the water that grows smooth again.</p>
			<p>Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed<br/>
			Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,<br/>
			When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!</p>
			<p>The con-created and perpetual thirst<br/>
			For the realm deiform did bear us on,<br/>
			As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.</p>
			<p>Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;<br/>
			And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt<br/>
			And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,</p>
			<p>Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing<br/>
			Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she<br/>
			From whom no care of mine could be concealed,</p>
			<p>Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Fix gratefully thy mind<br/>
			On God, who unto the first star has brought us."</p>
			<p>It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,<br/>
			Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright<br/>
			As adamant on which the sun is striking.</p>
			<p>Into itself did the eternal pearl<br/>
			Receive us, even as water doth receive<br/>
			A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.</p>
			<p>If I was body, (and we here conceive not<br/>
			How one dimension tolerates another,<br/>
			Which needs must be if body enter body,)</p>
			<p>More the desire should be enkindled in us<br/>
			That essence to behold, wherein is seen<br/>
			How God and our own nature were united.</p>
			<p>There will be seen what we receive by faith,<br/>
			Not demonstrated, but self-evident<br/>
			In guise of the first truth that man believes.</p>
			<p>I made reply: "Madonna, as devoutly<br/>
			As most I can do I give thanks to Him<br/>
			Who has removed me from the mortal world.</p>
			<p>But tell me what the dusky spots may be<br/>
			Upon this body, which below on earth<br/>
			Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?"</p>
			<p>Somewhat she smiled; and then, "If the opinion<br/>
			Of mortals be erroneous," she said,<br/>
			"Where'er the key of sense doth not unlock,</p>
			<p>Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee<br/>
			Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,<br/>
			Thou seest that the reason has short wings.</p>
			<p>But tell me what thou think'st of it thyself."<br/>
			And I: "What seems to us up here diverse,<br/>
			Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense."</p>
			<p>And she: "Right truly shalt thou see immersed<br/>
			In error thy belief, if well thou hearest<br/>
			The argument that I shall make against it.</p>
			<p>Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you<br/>
			Which in their quality and quantity<br/>
			May noted be of aspects different.</p>
			<p>If this were caused by rare and dense alone,<br/>
			One only virtue would there be in all<br/>
			Or more or less diffused, or equally.</p>
			<p>Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits<br/>
			Of formal principles; and these, save one,<br/>
			Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.</p>
			<p>Besides, if rarity were of this dimness<br/>
			The cause thou askest, either through and through<br/>
			This planet thus attenuate were of matter,</p>
			<p>Or else, as in a body is apportioned<br/>
			The fat and lean, so in like manner this<br/>
			Would in its volume interchange the leaves.</p>
			<p>Were it the former, in the sun's eclipse<br/>
			It would be manifest by the shining through<br/>
			Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.</p>
			<p>This is not so; hence we must scan the other,<br/>
			And if it chance the other I demolish,<br/>
			Then falsified will thy opinion be.</p>
			<p>But if this rarity go not through and through,<br/>
			There needs must be a limit, beyond which<br/>
			Its contrary prevents the further passing,</p>
			<p>And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,<br/>
			Even as a colour cometh back from glass,<br/>
			The which behind itself concealeth lead.</p>
			<p>Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself<br/>
			More dimly there than in the other parts,<br/>
			By being there reflected farther back.</p>
			<p>From this reply experiment will free thee<br/>
			If e'er thou try it, which is wont to be<br/>
			The fountain to the rivers of your arts.</p>
			<p>Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove<br/>
			Alike from thee, the other more remote<br/>
			Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.</p>
			<p>Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back<br/>
			Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors<br/>
			And coming back to thee by all reflected.</p>
			<p>Though in its quantity be not so ample<br/>
			The image most remote, there shalt thou see<br/>
			How it perforce is equally resplendent.</p>
			<p>Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays<br/>
			Naked the subject of the snow remains<br/>
			Both of its former colour and its cold,</p>
			<p>Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,<br/>
			Will I inform with such a living light,<br/>
			That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.</p>
			<p>Within the heaven of the divine repose<br/>
			Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies<br/>
			The being of whatever it contains.</p>
			<p>The following heaven, that has so many eyes,<br/>
			Divides this being by essences diverse,<br/>
			Distinguished from it, and by it contained.</p>
			<p>The other spheres, by various differences,<br/>
			All the distinctions which they have within them<br/>
			Dispose unto their ends and their effects.</p>
			<p>Thus do these organs of the world proceed,<br/>
			As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;<br/>
			Since from above they take, and act beneath.</p>
			<p>Observe me well, how through this place I come<br/>
			Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter<br/>
			Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford</p>
			<p>The power and motion of the holy spheres,<br/>
			As from the artisan the hammer's craft,<br/>
			Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.</p>
			<p>The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,<br/>
			From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,<br/>
			The image takes, and makes of it a seal.</p>
			<p>And even as the soul within your dust<br/>
			Through members different and accommodated<br/>
			To faculties diverse expands itself,</p>
			<p>So likewise this Intelligence diffuses<br/>
			Its virtue multiplied among the stars.<br/>
			Itself revolving on its unity.</p>
			<p>Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage<br/>
			Make with the precious body that it quickens,<br/>
			In which, as life in you, it is combined.</p>
			<p>From the glad nature whence it is derived,<br/>
			The mingled virtue through the body shines,<br/>
			Even as gladness through the living pupil.</p>
			<p>From this proceeds whate'er from light to light<br/>
			Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:<br/>
			This is the formal principle that produces,</p>
			<p>According to its goodness, dark and bright."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto III</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,<br/>
			Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,<br/>
			By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.</p>
			<p>And, that I might confess myself convinced<br/>
			And confident, so far as was befitting,<br/>
			I lifted more erect my head to speak.</p>
			<p>But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me<br/>
			So close to it, in order to be seen,<br/>
			That my confession I remembered not.</p>
			<p>Such as through polished and transparent glass,<br/>
			Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,<br/>
			But not so deep as that their bed be lost,</p>
			<p>Come back again the outlines of our faces<br/>
			So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white<br/>
			Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;</p>
			<p>Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,<br/>
			So that I ran in error opposite<br/>
			To that which kindled love 'twixt man and fountain.</p>
			<p>As soon as I became aware of them,<br/>
			Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,<br/>
			To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,</p>
			<p>And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward<br/>
			Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,<br/>
			Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.</p>
			<p>"Marvel thou not," she said to me, "because<br/>
			I smile at this thy puerile conceit,<br/>
			Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,</p>
			<p>But turns thee, as 'tis wont, on emptiness.<br/>
			True substances are these which thou beholdest,<br/>
			Here relegate for breaking of some vow.</p>
			<p>Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;<br/>
			For the true light, which giveth peace to them,<br/>
			Permits them not to turn from it their feet."</p>
			<p>And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful<br/>
			To speak directed me, and I began,<br/>
			As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:</p>
			<p>"O well-created spirit, who in the rays<br/>
			Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste<br/>
			Which being untasted ne'er is comprehended,</p>
			<p>Grateful 'twill be to me, if thou content me<br/>
			Both with thy name and with your destiny."<br/>
			Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:</p>
			<p>"Our charity doth never shut the doors<br/>
			Against a just desire, except as one<br/>
			Who wills that all her court be like herself.</p>
			<p>I was a virgin sister in the world;<br/>
			And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,<br/>
			The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,</p>
			<p>But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,<br/>
			Who, stationed here among these other blessed,<br/>
			Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.</p>
			<p>All our affections, that alone inflamed<br/>
			Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,<br/>
			Rejoice at being of his order formed;</p>
			<p>And this allotment, which appears so low,<br/>
			Therefore is given us, because our vows<br/>
			Have been neglected and in some part void."</p>
			<p>Whence I to her: "In your miraculous aspects<br/>
			There shines I know not what of the divine,<br/>
			Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.</p>
			<p>Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;<br/>
			But what thou tellest me now aids me so,<br/>
			That the refiguring is easier to me.</p>
			<p>But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,<br/>
			Are you desirous of a higher place,<br/>
			To see more or to make yourselves more friends?"</p>
			<p>First with those other shades she smiled a little;<br/>
			Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,<br/>
			She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:</p>
			<p>"Brother, our will is quieted by virtue<br/>
			Of charity, that makes us wish alone<br/>
			For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.</p>
			<p>If to be more exalted we aspired,<br/>
			Discordant would our aspirations be<br/>
			Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;</p>
			<p>Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,<br/>
			If being in charity is needful here,<br/>
			And if thou lookest well into its nature;</p>
			<p>Nay, 'tis essential to this blest existence<br/>
			To keep itself within the will divine,<br/>
			Whereby our very wishes are made one;</p>
			<p>So that, as we are station above station<br/>
			Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing,<br/>
			As to the King, who makes his will our will.</p>
			<p>And his will is our peace; this is the sea<br/>
			To which is moving onward whatsoever<br/>
			It doth create, and all that nature makes."</p>
			<p>Then it was clear to me how everywhere<br/>
			In heaven is Paradise, although the grace<br/>
			Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.</p>
			<p>But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,<br/>
			And for another still remains the longing,<br/>
			We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,</p>
			<p>E'en thus did I; with gesture and with word,<br/>
			To learn from her what was the web wherein<br/>
			She did not ply the shuttle to the end.</p>
			<p>"A perfect life and merit high in-heaven<br/>
			A lady o'er us," said she, "by whose rule<br/>
			Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,</p>
			<p>That until death they may both watch and sleep<br/>
			Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts<br/>
			Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.</p>
			<p>To follow her, in girlhood from the world<br/>
			I fled, and in her habit shut myself,<br/>
			And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.</p>
			<p>Then men accustomed unto evil more<br/>
			Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;<br/>
			God knows what afterward my life became.</p>
			<p>This other splendour, which to thee reveals<br/>
			Itself on my right side, and is enkindled<br/>
			With all the illumination of our sphere,</p>
			<p>What of myself I say applies to her;<br/>
			A nun was she, and likewise from her head<br/>
			Was ta'en the shadow of the sacred wimple.</p>
			<p>But when she too was to the world returned<br/>
			Against her wishes and against good usage,<br/>
			Of the heart's veil she never was divested.</p>
			<p>Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,<br/>
			Who from the second wind of Suabia<br/>
			Brought forth the third and latest puissance."</p>
			<p>Thus unto me she spake, and then began<br/>
			"Ave Maria" singing, and in singing<br/>
			Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.</p>
			<p>My sight, that followed her as long a time<br/>
			As it was possible, when it had lost her<br/>
			Turned round unto the mark of more desire,</p>
			<p>And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;<br/>
			But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,<br/>
			That at the first my sight endured it not;</p>
			<p>And this in questioning more backward made me.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto IV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Between two viands, equally removed<br/>
			And tempting, a free man would die of hunger<br/>
			Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.</p>
			<p>So would a lamb between the ravenings<br/>
			Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;<br/>
			And so would stand a dog between two does.</p>
			<p>Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,<br/>
			Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,<br/>
			Since it must be so, nor do I commend.</p>
			<p>I held my peace; but my desire was painted<br/>
			Upon my face, and questioning with that<br/>
			More fervent far than by articulate speech.</p>
			<p>Beatrice did as Daniel had done<br/>
			Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath<br/>
			Which rendered him unjustly merciless,</p>
			<p>And said: "Well see I how attracteth thee<br/>
			One and the other wish, so that thy care<br/>
			Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.</p>
			<p>Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,<br/>
			The violence of others, for what reason<br/>
			Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?</p>
			<p>Again for doubting furnish thee occasion<br/>
			Souls seeming to return unto the stars,<br/>
			According to the sentiment of Plato.</p>
			<p>These are the questions which upon thy wish<br/>
			Are thrusting equally; and therefore first<br/>
			Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.</p>
			<p>He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,<br/>
			Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John<br/>
			Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,</p>
			<p>Have not in any other heaven their seats,<br/>
			Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,<br/>
			Nor of existence more or fewer years;</p>
			<p>But all make beautiful the primal circle,<br/>
			And have sweet life in different degrees,<br/>
			By feeling more or less the eternal breath.</p>
			<p>They showed themselves here, not because allotted<br/>
			This sphere has been to them, but to give sign<br/>
			Of the celestial which is least exalted.</p>
			<p>To speak thus is adapted to your mind,<br/>
			Since only through the sense it apprehendeth<br/>
			What then it worthy makes of intellect.</p>
			<p>On this account the Scripture condescends<br/>
			Unto your faculties, and feet and hands<br/>
			To God attributes, and means something else;</p>
			<p>And Holy Church under an aspect human<br/>
			Gabriel and Michael represent to you,<br/>
			And him who made Tobias whole again.</p>
			<p>That which Timaeus argues of the soul<br/>
			Doth not resemble that which here is seen,<br/>
			Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.</p>
			<p>He says the soul unto its star returns,<br/>
			Believing it to have been severed thence<br/>
			Whenever nature gave it as a form.</p>
			<p>Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise<br/>
			Than the words sound, and possibly may be<br/>
			With meaning that is not to be derided.</p>
			<p>If he doth mean that to these wheels return<br/>
			The honour of their influence and the blame,<br/>
			Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.</p>
			<p>This principle ill understood once warped<br/>
			The whole world nearly, till it went astray<br/>
			Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.</p>
			<p>The other doubt which doth disquiet thee<br/>
			Less venom has, for its malevolence<br/>
			Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.</p>
			<p>That as unjust our justice should appear<br/>
			In eyes of mortals, is an argument<br/>
			Of faith, and not of sin heretical.</p>
			<p>But still, that your perception may be able<br/>
			To thoroughly penetrate this verity,<br/>
			As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.</p>
			<p>If it be violence when he who suffers<br/>
			Co-operates not with him who uses force,<br/>
			These souls were not on that account excused;</p>
			<p>For will is never quenched unless it will,<br/>
			But operates as nature doth in fire<br/>
			If violence a thousand times distort it.</p>
			<p>Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds<br/>
			The force; and these have done so, having power<br/>
			Of turning back unto the holy place.</p>
			<p>If their will had been perfect, like to that<br/>
			Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,<br/>
			And Mutius made severe to his own hand,</p>
			<p>It would have urged them back along the road<br/>
			Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;<br/>
			But such a solid will is all too rare.</p>
			<p>And by these words, if thou hast gathered them<br/>
			As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted<br/>
			That would have still annoyed thee many times.</p>
			<p>But now another passage runs across<br/>
			Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself<br/>
			Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.</p>
			<p>I have for certain put into thy mind<br/>
			That soul beatified could never lie,<br/>
			For it is near the primal Truth,</p>
			<p>And then thou from Piccarda might'st have heard<br/>
			Costanza kept affection for the veil,<br/>
			So that she seemeth here to contradict me.</p>
			<p>Many times, brother, has it come to pass,<br/>
			That, to escape from peril, with reluctance<br/>
			That has been done it was not right to do,</p>
			<p>E'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<br/>
			Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)<br/>
			Not to lose pity pitiless became.</p>
			<p>At this point I desire thee to remember<br/>
			That force with will commingles, and they cause<br/>
			That the offences cannot be excused.</p>
			<p>Will absolute consenteth not to evil;<br/>
			But in so far consenteth as it fears,<br/>
			If it refrain, to fall into more harm.</p>
			<p>Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,<br/>
			She meaneth the will absolute, and I<br/>
			The other, so that both of us speak truth."</p>
			<p>Such was the flowing of the holy river<br/>
			That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;<br/>
			This put to rest my wishes one and all.</p>
			<p>"O love of the first lover, O divine,"<br/>
			Said I forthwith, "whose speech inundates me<br/>
			And warms me so, it more and more revives me,</p>
			<p>My own affection is not so profound<br/>
			As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;<br/>
			Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.</p>
			<p>Well I perceive that never sated is<br/>
			Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,<br/>
			Beyond which nothing true expands itself.</p>
			<p>It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,<br/>
			When it attains it; and it can attain it;<br/>
			If not, then each desire would frustrate be.</p>
			<p>Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,<br/>
			Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<br/>
			Which to the top from height to height impels us.</p>
			<p>This doth invite me, this assurance give me<br/>
			With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you<br/>
			Another truth, which is obscure to me.</p>
			<p>I wish to know if man can satisfy you<br/>
			For broken vows with other good deeds, so<br/>
			That in your balance they will not be light."</p>
			<p>Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<br/>
			Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,<br/>
			That, overcome my power, I turned my back</p>
			<p>And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto V</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<br/>
			Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,<br/>
			So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,</p>
			<p>Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds<br/>
			From perfect sight, which as it apprehends<br/>
			To the good apprehended moves its feet.</p>
			<p>Well I perceive how is already shining<br/>
			Into thine intellect the eternal light,<br/>
			That only seen enkindles always love;</p>
			<p>And if some other thing your love seduce,<br/>
			'Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,<br/>
			Ill understood, which there is shining through.</p>
			<p>Thou fain wouldst know if with another service<br/>
			For broken vow can such return be made<br/>
			As to secure the soul from further claim."</p>
			<p>This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;<br/>
			And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,<br/>
			Continued thus her holy argument:</p>
			<p>"The greatest gift that in his largess God<br/>
			Creating made, and unto his own goodness<br/>
			Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize</p>
			<p>Most highly, is the freedom of the will,<br/>
			Wherewith the creatures of intelligence<br/>
			Both all and only were and are endowed.</p>
			<p>Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,<br/>
			The high worth of a vow, if it he made<br/>
			So that when thou consentest God consents:</p>
			<p>For, closing between God and man the compact,<br/>
			A sacrifice is of this treasure made,<br/>
			Such as I say, and made by its own act.</p>
			<p>What can be rendered then as compensation?<br/>
			Think'st thou to make good use of what thou'st offered,<br/>
			With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.</p>
			<p>Now art thou certain of the greater point;<br/>
			But because Holy Church in this dispenses,<br/>
			Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,</p>
			<p>Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,<br/>
			Because the solid food which thou hast taken<br/>
			Requireth further aid for thy digestion.</p>
			<p>Open thy mind to that which I reveal,<br/>
			And fix it there within; for 'tis not knowledge,<br/>
			The having heard without retaining it.</p>
			<p>In the essence of this sacrifice two things<br/>
			Convene together; and the one is that<br/>
			Of which 'tis made, the other is the agreement.</p>
			<p>This last for evermore is cancelled not<br/>
			Unless complied with, and concerning this<br/>
			With such precision has above been spoken.</p>
			<p>Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews<br/>
			To offer still, though sometimes what was offered<br/>
			Might be commuted, as thou ought'st to know.</p>
			<p>The other, which is known to thee as matter,<br/>
			May well indeed be such that one errs not<br/>
			If it for other matter be exchanged.</p>
			<p>But let none shift the burden on his shoulder<br/>
			At his arbitrament, without the turning<br/>
			Both of the white and of the yellow key;</p>
			<p>And every permutation deem as foolish,<br/>
			If in the substitute the thing relinquished,<br/>
			As the four is in six, be not contained.</p>
			<p>Therefore whatever thing has so great weight<br/>
			In value that it drags down every balance,<br/>
			Cannot be satisfied with other spending.</p>
			<p>Let mortals never take a vow in jest;<br/>
			Be faithful and not blind in doing that,<br/>
			As Jephthah was in his first offering,</p>
			<p>Whom more beseemed to say, 'I have done wrong,<br/>
			Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish<br/>
			Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,</p>
			<p>Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<br/>
			And made for her both wise and simple weep,<br/>
			Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.'</p>
			<p>Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;<br/>
			Be ye not like a feather at each wind,<br/>
			And think not every water washes you.</p>
			<p>Ye have the Old and the New Testament,<br/>
			And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you<br/>
			Let this suffice you unto your salvation.</p>
			<p>If evil appetite cry aught else to you,<br/>
			Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<br/>
			So that the Jew among you may not mock you.</p>
			<p>Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<br/>
			Its mother's milk, and frolicsome and simple<br/>
			Combats at its own pleasure with itself."</p>
			<p>Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;<br/>
			Then all desireful turned herself again<br/>
			To that part where the world is most alive.</p>
			<p>Her silence and her change of countenance<br/>
			Silence imposed upon my eager mind,<br/>
			That had already in advance new questions;</p>
			<p>And as an arrow that upon the mark<br/>
			Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,<br/>
			So did we speed into the second realm.</p>
			<p>My Lady there so joyful I beheld,<br/>
			As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<br/>
			More luminous thereat the planet grew;</p>
			<p>And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<br/>
			What became I, who by my nature am<br/>
			Exceeding mutable in every guise!</p>
			<p>As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,<br/>
			The fishes draw to that which from without<br/>
			Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;</p>
			<p>So I beheld more than a thousand splendours<br/>
			Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:<br/>
			"Lo, this is she who shall increase our love."</p>
			<p>And as each one was coming unto us,<br/>
			Full of beatitude the shade was seen,<br/>
			By the effulgence clear that issued from it.</p>
			<p>Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning<br/>
			No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have<br/>
			An agonizing need of knowing more;</p>
			<p>And of thyself thou'lt see how I from these<br/>
			Was in desire of hearing their conditions,<br/>
			As they unto mine eyes were manifest.</p>
			<p>"O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes<br/>
			To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,<br/>
			Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned</p>
			<p>With light that through the whole of heaven is spread<br/>
			Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest<br/>
			To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee."</p>
			<p>Thus by some one among those holy spirits<br/>
			Was spoken, and by Beatrice: "Speak, speak<br/>
			Securely, and believe them even as Gods."</p>
			<p>"Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself<br/>
			In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,<br/>
			Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,</p>
			<p>But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,<br/>
			Spirit august, thy station in the sphere<br/>
			That veils itself to men in alien rays."</p>
			<p>This said I in direction of the light<br/>
			Which first had spoken to me; whence it became<br/>
			By far more lucent than it was before.</p>
			<p>Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<br/>
			By too much light, when heat has worn away<br/>
			The tempering influence of the vapours dense,</p>
			<p>By greater rapture thus concealed itself<br/>
			In its own radiance the figure saintly,<br/>
			And thus close, close enfolded answered me</p>
			<p>In fashion as the following Canto sings.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto VI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"After that Constantine the eagle turned<br/>
			Against the course of heaven, which it had followed<br/>
			Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,</p>
			<p>Two hundred years and more the bird of God<br/>
			In the extreme of Europe held itself,<br/>
			Near to the mountains whence it issued first;</p>
			<p>And under shadow of the sacred plumes<br/>
			It governed there the world from hand to hand,<br/>
			And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.</p>
			<p>Caesar I was, and am Justinian,<br/>
			Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,<br/>
			Took from the laws the useless and redundant;</p>
			<p>And ere unto the work I was attent,<br/>
			One nature to exist in Christ, not more,<br/>
			Believed, and with such faith was I contented.</p>
			<p>But blessed Agapetus, he who was<br/>
			The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere<br/>
			Pointed me out the way by words of his.</p>
			<p>Him I believed, and what was his assertion<br/>
			I now see clearly, even as thou seest<br/>
			Each contradiction to be false and true.</p>
			<p>As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,<br/>
			God in his grace it pleased with this high task<br/>
			To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,</p>
			<p>And to my Belisarius I commended<br/>
			The arms, to which was heaven's right hand so joined<br/>
			It was a signal that I should repose.</p>
			<p>Now here to the first question terminates<br/>
			My answer; but the character thereof<br/>
			Constrains me to continue with a sequel,</p>
			<p>In order that thou see with how great reason<br/>
			Men move against the standard sacrosanct,<br/>
			Both who appropriate and who oppose it.</p>
			<p>Behold how great a power has made it worthy<br/>
			Of reverence, beginning from the hour<br/>
			When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.</p>
			<p>Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode<br/>
			Three hundred years and upward, till at last<br/>
			The three to three fought for it yet again.</p>
			<p>Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong<br/>
			Down to Lucretia's sorrow, in seven kings<br/>
			O'ercoming round about the neighboring nations;</p>
			<p>Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans<br/>
			Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,<br/>
			Against the other princes and confederates.</p>
			<p>Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks<br/>
			Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,<br/>
			Received the fame I willingly embalm;</p>
			<p>It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,<br/>
			Who, following Hannibal, had passed across<br/>
			The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;</p>
			<p>Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young<br/>
			Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill<br/>
			Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;</p>
			<p>Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed<br/>
			To bring the whole world to its mood serene,<br/>
			Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.</p>
			<p>What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,<br/>
			Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,<br/>
			And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;</p>
			<p>What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,<br/>
			And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight<br/>
			That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.</p>
			<p>Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then<br/>
			Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote<br/>
			That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.</p>
			<p>Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,<br/>
			It saw again, and there where Hector lies,<br/>
			And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.</p>
			<p>From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;<br/>
			Then wheeled itself again into your West,<br/>
			Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.</p>
			<p>From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer<br/>
			Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,<br/>
			And Modena and Perugia dolent were;</p>
			<p>Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep<br/>
			Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,<br/>
			Took from the adder sudden and black death.</p>
			<p>With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;<br/>
			With him it placed the world in so great peace,<br/>
			That unto Janus was his temple closed.</p>
			<p>But what the standard that has made me speak<br/>
			Achieved before, and after should achieve<br/>
			Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,</p>
			<p>Becometh in appearance mean and dim,<br/>
			If in the hand of the third Caesar seen<br/>
			With eye unclouded and affection pure,</p>
			<p>Because the living Justice that inspires me<br/>
			Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,<br/>
			The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.</p>
			<p>Now here attend to what I answer thee;<br/>
			Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance<br/>
			Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.</p>
			<p>And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten<br/>
			The Holy Church, then underneath its wings<br/>
			Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.</p>
			<p>Now hast thou power to judge of such as those<br/>
			Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,<br/>
			Which are the cause of all your miseries.</p>
			<p>To the public standard one the yellow lilies<br/>
			Opposes, the other claims it for a party,<br/>
			So that 'tis hard to see which sins the most.</p>
			<p>Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft<br/>
			Beneath some other standard; for this ever<br/>
			Ill follows he who it and justice parts.</p>
			<p>And let not this new Charles e'er strike it down,<br/>
			He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons<br/>
			That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.</p>
			<p>Already oftentimes the sons have wept<br/>
			The father's crime; and let him not believe<br/>
			That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.</p>
			<p>This little planet doth adorn itself<br/>
			With the good spirits that have active been,<br/>
			That fame and honour might come after them;</p>
			<p>And whensoever the desires mount thither,<br/>
			Thus deviating, must perforce the rays<br/>
			Of the true love less vividly mount upward.</p>
			<p>But in commensuration of our wages<br/>
			With our desert is portion of our joy,<br/>
			Because we see them neither less nor greater.</p>
			<p>Herein doth living Justice sweeten so<br/>
			Affection in us, that for evermore<br/>
			It cannot warp to any iniquity.</p>
			<p>Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;<br/>
			So in this life of ours the seats diverse<br/>
			Render sweet harmony among these spheres;</p>
			<p>And in the compass of this present pearl<br/>
			Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom<br/>
			The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.</p>
			<p>But the Provencals who against him wrought,<br/>
			They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he<br/>
			Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.</p>
			<p>Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,<br/>
			Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him<br/>
			Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;</p>
			<p>And then malicious words incited him<br/>
			To summon to a reckoning this just man,<br/>
			Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.</p>
			<p>Then he departed poor and stricken in years,<br/>
			And if the world could know the heart he had,<br/>
			In begging bit by bit his livelihood,</p>
			<p>Though much it laud him, it would laud him more."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto VII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,<br/>

			Felices ignes horum malahoth!"</p>
			<p>In this wise, to his melody returning,<br/>
			This substance, upon which a double light<br/>
			Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,</p>
			<p>And to their dance this and the others moved,<br/>
			And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks<br/>
			Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.</p>
			<p>Doubting was I, and saying, "Tell her, tell her,"<br/>
			Within me, "tell her," saying, "tell my Lady,"<br/>
			Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;</p>
			<p>And yet that reverence which doth lord it over<br/>
			The whole of me only by B and ICE,<br/>
			Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.</p>
			<p>Short while did Beatrice endure me thus;<br/>
			And she began, lighting me with a smile<br/>
			Such as would make one happy in the fire:</p>
			<p>"According to infallible advisement,<br/>
			After what manner a just vengeance justly<br/>
			Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,</p>
			<p>But I will speedily thy mind unloose;<br/>
			And do thou listen, for these words of mine<br/>
			Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.</p>
			<p>By not enduring on the power that wills<br/>
			Curb for his good, that man who ne'er was born,<br/>
			Damning himself damned all his progeny;</p>
			<p>Whereby the human species down below<br/>
			Lay sick for many centuries in great error,<br/>
			Till to descend it pleased the Word of God</p>
			<p>To where the nature, which from its own Maker<br/>
			Estranged itself, he joined to him in person<br/>
			By the sole act of his eternal love.</p>
			<p>Now unto what is said direct thy sight;<br/>
			This nature when united to its Maker,<br/>
			Such as created, was sincere and good;</p>
			<p>But by itself alone was banished forth<br/>
			From Paradise, because it turned aside<br/>
			Out of the way of truth and of its life.</p>
			<p>Therefore the penalty the cross held out,<br/>
			If measured by the nature thus assumed,<br/>
			None ever yet with so great justice stung,</p>
			<p>And none was ever of so great injustice,<br/>
			Considering who the Person was that suffered,<br/>
			Within whom such a nature was contracted.</p>
			<p>From one act therefore issued things diverse;<br/>
			To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;<br/>
			Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.</p>
			<p>It should no longer now seem difficult<br/>
			To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance<br/>
			By a just court was afterward avenged.</p>
			<p>But now do I behold thy mind entangled<br/>
			From thought to thought within a knot, from which<br/>
			With great desire it waits to free itself.</p>
			<p>Thou sayest, 'Well discern I what I hear;<br/>
			But it is hidden from me why God willed<br/>
			For our redemption only this one mode.'</p>
			<p>Buried remaineth, brother, this decree<br/>
			Unto the eyes of every one whose nature<br/>
			Is in the flame of love not yet adult.</p>
			<p>Verily, inasmuch as at this mark<br/>
			One gazes long and little is discerned,<br/>
			Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.</p>
			<p>Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn<br/>
			All envy, burning in itself so sparkles<br/>
			That the eternal beauties it unfolds.</p>
			<p>Whate'er from this immediately distils<br/>
			Has afterwards no end, for ne'er removed<br/>
			Is its impression when it sets its seal.</p>
			<p>Whate'er from this immediately rains down<br/>
			Is wholly free, because it is not subject<br/>
			Unto the influences of novel things.</p>
			<p>The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;<br/>
			For the blest ardour that irradiates all things<br/>
			In that most like itself is most vivacious.</p>
			<p>With all of these things has advantaged been<br/>
			The human creature; and if one be wanting,<br/>
			From his nobility he needs must fall.</p>
			<p>'Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,<br/>
			And render him unlike the Good Supreme,<br/>
			So that he little with its light is blanched,</p>
			<p>And to his dignity no more returns,<br/>
			Unless he fill up where transgression empties<br/>
			With righteous pains for criminal delights.</p>
			<p>Your nature when it sinned so utterly<br/>
			In its own seed, out of these dignities<br/>
			Even as out of Paradise was driven,</p>
			<p>Nor could itself recover, if thou notest<br/>
			With nicest subtilty, by any way,<br/>
			Except by passing one of these two fords:</p>
			<p>Either that God through clemency alone<br/>
			Had pardon granted, or that man himself<br/>
			Had satisfaction for his folly made.</p>
			<p>Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss<br/>
			Of the eternal counsel, to my speech<br/>
			As far as may be fastened steadfastly!</p>
			<p>Man in his limitations had not power<br/>
			To satisfy, not having power to sink<br/>
			In his humility obeying then,</p>
			<p>Far as he disobeying thought to rise;<br/>
			And for this reason man has been from power<br/>
			Of satisfying by himself excluded.</p>
			<p>Therefore it God behoved in his own ways<br/>
			Man to restore unto his perfect life,<br/>
			I say in one, or else in both of them.</p>
			<p>But since the action of the doer is<br/>
			So much more grateful, as it more presents<br/>
			The goodness of the heart from which it issues,</p>
			<p>Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,<br/>
			Has been contented to proceed by each<br/>
			And all its ways to lift you up again;</p>
			<p>Nor 'twixt the first day and the final night<br/>
			Such high and such magnificent proceeding<br/>
			By one or by the other was or shall be;</p>
			<p>For God more bounteous was himself to give<br/>
			To make man able to uplift himself,<br/>
			Than if he only of himself had pardoned;</p>
			<p>And all the other modes were insufficient<br/>
			For justice, were it not the Son of God<br/>
			Himself had humbled to become incarnate.</p>
			<p>Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,<br/>
			Return I to elucidate one place,<br/>
			In order that thou there mayst see as I do.</p>
			<p>Thou sayst: 'I see the air, I see the fire,<br/>
			The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures<br/>
			Come to corruption, and short while endure;</p>
			<p>And these things notwithstanding were created;'<br/>
			Therefore if that which I have said were true,<br/>
			They should have been secure against corruption.</p>
			<p>The Angels, brother, and the land sincere<br/>
			In which thou art, created may be called<br/>
			Just as they are in their entire existence;</p>
			<p>But all the elements which thou hast named,<br/>
			And all those things which out of them are made,<br/>
			By a created virtue are informed.</p>
			<p>Created was the matter which they have;<br/>
			Created was the informing influence<br/>
			Within these stars that round about them go.</p>
			<p>The soul of every brute and of the plants<br/>
			By its potential temperament attracts<br/>
			The ray and motion of the holy lights;</p>
			<p>But your own life immediately inspires<br/>
			Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it<br/>
			So with herself, it evermore desires her.</p>
			<p>And thou from this mayst argue furthermore<br/>
			Your resurrection, if thou think again<br/>
			How human flesh was fashioned at that time</p>
			<p>When the first parents both of them were made."</p>

			<p>To any one who had those lights divine<br/>
			Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration<br/>
			Begun at first in the high Seraphim.</p>
			<p>And behind those that most in front appeared<br/>
			Sounded "Osanna!" so that never since<br/>
			To hear again was I without desire.</p>
			<p>Then unto us more nearly one approached,<br/>
			And it alone began: "We all are ready<br/>
			Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.</p>
			<p>We turn around with the celestial Princes,<br/>
			One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,<br/>
			To whom thou in the world of old didst say,</p>
			<p>'Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;'<br/>
			And are so full of love, to pleasure thee<br/>
			A little quiet will not be less sweet."</p>
			<p>After these eyes of mine themselves had offered<br/>
			Unto my Lady reverently, and she<br/>
			Content and certain of herself had made them,</p>
			<p>Back to the light they turned, which so great promise<br/>
			Made of itself, and "Say, who art thou?" was<br/>
			My voice, imprinted with a great affection.</p>
			<p>O how and how much I beheld it grow<br/>
			With the new joy that superadded was<br/>
			Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!</p>
			<p>Thus changed, it said to me: "The world possessed me<br/>
			Short time below; and, if it had been more,<br/>
			Much evil will be which would not have been.</p>
			<p>My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,<br/>
			Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me<br/>
			Like as a creature swathed in its own silk.</p>
			<p>Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason;<br/>
			For had I been below, I should have shown thee<br/>
			Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love.</p>
			<p>That left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself<br/>
			In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue,<br/>
			Me for its lord awaited in due time,</p>
			<p>And that horn of Ausonia, which is towned<br/>
			With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona,<br/>
			Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge.</p>
			<p>Already flashed upon my brow the crown<br/>
			Of that dominion which the Danube waters<br/>
			After the German borders it abandons;</p>
			<p>And beautiful Trinacria, that is murky<br/>
			'Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf<br/>
			Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,)</p>
			<p>Not through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur,<br/>
			Would have awaited her own monarchs still,<br/>
			Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph,</p>
			<p>If evil lordship, that exasperates ever<br/>
			The subject populations, had not moved<br/>
			Palermo to the outcry of 'Death! death!'</p>
			<p>And if my brother could but this foresee,<br/>
			The greedy poverty of Catalonia<br/>
			Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him;</p>
			<p>For verily 'tis needful to provide,<br/>
			Through him or other, so that on his bark<br/>
			Already freighted no more freight be placed.</p>
			<p>His nature, which from liberal covetous<br/>
			Descended, such a soldiery would need<br/>
			As should not care for hoarding in a chest."</p>
			<p>"Because I do believe the lofty joy<br/>
			Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord,<br/>
			Where every good thing doth begin and end</p>
			<p>Thou seest as I see it, the more grateful<br/>
			Is it to me; and this too hold I dear,<br/>
			That gazing upon God thou dost discern it.</p>
			<p>Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me,<br/>
			Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt,<br/>
			How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth."</p>
			<p>This I to him; and he to me: "If I<br/>
			Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest<br/>
			Thy face thou'lt hold as thou dost hold thy back.</p>
			<p>The Good which all the realm thou art ascending<br/>
			Turns and contents, maketh its providence<br/>
			To be a power within these bodies vast;</p>
			<p>And not alone the natures are foreseen<br/>
			Within the mind that in itself is perfect,<br/>
			But they together with their preservation.</p>
			<p>For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth<br/>
			Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen,<br/>
			Even as a shaft directed to its mark.</p>
			<p>If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk<br/>
			Would in such manner its effects produce,<br/>
			That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.</p>
			<p>This cannot be, if the Intelligences<br/>
			That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,<br/>
			And maimed the First that has not made them perfect.</p>
			<p>Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?"<br/>
			And I: "Not so; for 'tis impossible<br/>
			That nature tire, I see, in what is needful."</p>
			<p>Whence he again: "Now say, would it be worse<br/>
			For men on earth were they not citizens?"<br/>
			"Yes," I replied; "and here I ask no reason."</p>
			<p>"And can they be so, if below they live not<br/>
			Diversely unto offices diverse?<br/>
			No, if your master writeth well for you."</p>
			<p>So came he with deductions to this point;<br/>
			Then he concluded: "Therefore it behoves<br/>
			The roots of your effects to be diverse.</p>
			<p>Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes,<br/>
			Another Melchisedec, and another he<br/>
			Who, flying through the air, his son did lose.</p>
			<p>Revolving Nature, which a signet is<br/>
			To mortal wax, doth practise well her art,<br/>
			But not one inn distinguish from another;</p>
			<p>Thence happens it that Esau differeth<br/>
			In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes<br/>
			From sire so vile that he is given to Mars.</p>
			<p>A generated nature its own way<br/>
			Would always make like its progenitors,<br/>
			If Providence divine were not triumphant.</p>
			<p>Now that which was behind thee is before thee;<br/>
			But that thou know that I with thee am pleased,<br/>
			With a corollary will I mantle thee.</p>
			<p>Evermore nature, if it fortune find<br/>
			Discordant to it, like each other seed<br/>
			Out of its region, maketh evil thrift;</p>
			<p>And if the world below would fix its mind<br/>
			On the foundation which is laid by nature,<br/>
			Pursuing that, 'twould have the people good.</p>
			<p>But you unto religion wrench aside<br/>
			Him who was born to gird him with the sword,<br/>
			And make a king of him who is for sermons;</p>
			<p>Therefore your footsteps wander from the road."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto IX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Beautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles<br/>

			<p>But said: "Be still and let the years roll round;"<br/>

			Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs.</p>
			<p>And of that holy light the life already<br/>
			Had to the Sun which fills it turned again,<br/>
			As to that good which for each thing sufficeth.</p>
			<p>Ah, souls deceived, and creatures impious,<br/>
			Who from such good do turn away your hearts,<br/>
			Directing upon vanity your foreheads!</p>
			<p>And now, behold, another of those splendours<br/>

			<p>The eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were<br/>
			Upon me, as before, of dear assent<br/>

			<p>"Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish,<br/>

			That made upon that region great assault.</p>
			<p>Out of one root were born both I and it;<br/>
			Cunizza was I called, and here I shine<br/>
			Because the splendour of this star o'ercame me.</p>
			<p>But gladly to myself the cause I pardon<br/>
			Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me;<br/>
			Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar.</p>
			<p>Of this so luculent and precious jewel,<br/>
			Which of our heaven is nearest unto me,<br/>
			Great fame remained; and ere it die away</p>
			<p>This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be.<br/>

			Nor yet for being scourged is penitent.</p>
			<p>But soon 'twill be that Padua in the marsh<br/>
			Will change the water that Vicenza bathes,<br/>
			Because the folk are stubborn against duty;</p>
			<p>And where the Sile and Cagnano join<br/>
			One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head,<br/>
			For catching whom e'en now the net is making.</p>

			<p>Here it was silent, and it had the semblance<br/>
			Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel<br/>
			On which it entered as it was before.</p>
			<p>The other joy, already known to me,<br/>
			Became a thing transplendent in my sight,<br/>
			As a fine ruby smitten by the sun.</p>
			<p>Through joy effulgence is acquired above,<br/>
			As here a smile; but down below, the shade<br/>
			Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad.</p>
			<p>"God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit,<br/>
			Thy sight is," said I, "so that never will<br/>
			Of his can possibly from thee be hidden;</p>
			<p>Thy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens<br/>
			Glad, with the singing of those holy fires<br/>
			Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl,</p>
			<p>Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings?<br/>

			Than I, so long as it became my locks,</p>

			Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind,<br/>
			But at the power which ordered and foresaw.</p>

			And whose ambition is so sorely wept,</p>
			<p>Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower<br/>
			Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray<br/>
			Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf.</p>
			<p>For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors<br/>
			Are derelict, and only the Decretals<br/>
			So studied that it shows upon their margins.</p>
			<p>On this are Pope and Cardinals intent;<br/>

			<p>Lift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels<br/>

			<p>And I was with him; but of the ascending<br/>
			I was not conscious, saving as a man<br/>
			Of a first thought is conscious ere it come;</p>
			<p>And Beatrice, she who is seen to pass<br/>
			From good to better, and so suddenly<br/>
			That not by time her action is expressed,</p>
			<p>How lucent in herself must she have been!<br/>
			And what was in the sun, wherein I entered,<br/>
			Apparent not by colour but by light,</p>
			<p>I, though I call on genius, art, and practice,<br/>
			Cannot so tell that it could be imagined;<br/>
			Believe one can, and let him long to see it.</p>
			<p>And if our fantasies too lowly are<br/>
			For altitude so great, it is no marvel,<br/>
			Since o'er the sun was never eye could go.</p>
			<p>Such in this place was the fourth family<br/>
			Of the high Father, who forever sates it,<br/>
			Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.</p>
			<p>And Beatrice began: "Give thanks, give thanks<br/>
			Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this<br/>
			Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!"</p>
			<p>Never was heart of mortal so disposed<br/>
			To worship, nor to give itself to God<br/>
			With all its gratitude was it so ready,</p>
			<p>As at those words did I myself become;<br/>
			And all my love was so absorbed in Him,<br/>

			<p>Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it<br/>
			So that the splendour of her laughing eyes<br/>
			My single mind on many things divided.</p>
			<p>Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,<br/>
			Make us a centre and themselves a circle,<br/>

			So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.</p>
			<p>Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,<br/>
			Are many jewels found, so fair and precious<br/>

			<p>And of them was the singing of those lights.<br/>
			Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,<br/>
			The tidings thence may from the dumb await!</p>
			<p>As soon as singing thus those burning suns<br/>
			Had round about us whirled themselves three times,<br/>
			Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles,</p>
			<p>Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released,<br/>
			But who stop short, in silence listening<br/>
			Till they have gathered the new melody.</p>
			<p>And within one I heard beginning: "When<br/>
			The radiance of grace, by which is kindled<br/>
			True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,</p>
			<p>Within thee multiplied is so resplendent<br/>
			That it conducts thee upward by that stair,<br/>
			Where without reascending none descends,</p>
			<p>Who should deny the wine out of his vial<br/>

			Which Dominic conducteth by a road<br/>
			Where well one fattens if he strayeth not.</p>
			<p>He who is nearest to me on the right<br/>
			My brother and master was; and he Albertus<br/>
			Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum.</p>
			<p>If thou of all the others wouldst be certain,<br/>
			Follow behind my speaking with thy sight<br/>
			Upward along the blessed garland turning.</p>
			<p>That next effulgence issues from the smile<br/>
			Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts<br/>
			In such wise that it pleased in Paradise.</p>
			<p>The other which near by adorns our choir<br/>
			That Peter was who, e'en as the poor widow,<br/>
			Offered his treasure unto Holy Church.</p>
			<p>The fifth light, that among us is the fairest,<br/>
			Breathes forth from such a love, that all the world<br/>
			Below is greedy to learn tidings of it.</p>
			<p>Within it is the lofty mind, where knowledge<br/>
			So deep was put, that, if the true be true,<br/>
			To see so much there never rose a second.</p>
			<p>Thou seest next the lustre of that taper,<br/>
			Which in the flesh below looked most within<br/>

			<p>Within that other little light is smiling<br/>
			The advocate of the Christian centuries,<br/>
			Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished.</p>
			<p>Now if thou trainest thy mind's eye along<br/>

			And banishment it came unto this peace.</p>
			<p>See farther onward flame the burning breath<br/>
			Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard<br/>
			Who was in contemplation more than man.</p>
			<p>This, whence to me returneth thy regard,<br/>
			The light is of a spirit unto whom<br/>
			In his grave meditations death seemed slow.</p>
			<p>It is the light eternal of Sigier,<br/>
			Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw,<br/>
			Did syllogize invidious verities."</p>
			<p>Then, as a horologe that calleth us<br/>
			What time the Bride of God is rising up<br/>
			With matins to her Spouse that he may love her,</p>
			<p>Wherein one part the other draws and urges,<br/>
			Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note,<br/>
			That swells with love the spirit well disposed,</p>
			<p>Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round,<br/>
			And render voice to voice, in modulation<br/>
			And sweetness that can not be comprehended,</p>
			<p>Excepting there where joy is made eternal.</p>

			The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry,<br/>

			Which on this side and that might be her guide.</p>
			<p>The one was all seraphical in ardour;<br/>

			Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.</p>
			<p>From out that slope, there where it breaketh most<br/>
			Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun<br/>
			As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;</p>
			<p>Therefore let him who speaketh of that place,<br/>

			But Orient, if he properly would speak.</p>
			<p>He was not yet far distant from his rising<br/>
			Before he had begun to make the earth<br/>

			<p>For he in youth his father's wrath incurred<br/>
			For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,<br/>

			<p>And was before his spiritual court<br/>
			'Et coram patre' unto her united;<br/>

			<p>She, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,<br/>
			One thousand and one hundred years and more,<br/>
			Waited without a suitor till he came.</p>
			<p>Naught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas<br/>
			Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice<br/>
			He who struck terror into all the world;</p>
			<p>Naught it availed being constant and undaunted,<br/>
			So that, when Mary still remained below,<br/>

			Better in glory of the heavens were sung,</p>
			<p>Incoronated with a second crown<br/>
			Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit<br/>
			The holy purpose of this Archimandrite.</p>
			<p>And when he had, through thirst of martyrdom,<br/>
			In the proud presence of the Sultan preached<br/>
			Christ and the others who came after him,</p>
			<p>And, finding for conversion too unripe<br/>
			The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,<br/>
			Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,</p>
			<p>On the rude rock 'twixt Tiber and the Arno<br/>
			From Christ did he receive the final seal,<br/>
			Which during two whole years his members bore.</p>
			<p>When He, who chose him unto so much good,<br/>
			Was pleased to draw him up to the reward<br/>
			That he had merited by being lowly,</p>
			<p>Unto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,<br/>
			His most dear Lady did he recommend,<br/>
			And bade that they should love her faithfully;</p>
			<p>And from her bosom the illustrious soul<br/>
			Wished to depart, returning to its realm,<br/>
			And for its body wished no other bier.</p>
			<p>Think now what man was he, who was a fit<br/>
			Companion over the high seas to keep<br/>
			The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.</p>
			<p>And this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever<br/>
			Doth follow him as he commands can see<br/>
			That he is laden with good merchandise.</p>
			<p>But for new pasturage his flock has grown<br/>
			So greedy, that it is impossible<br/>
			They be not scattered over fields diverse;</p>
			<p>And in proportion as his sheep remote<br/>
			And vagabond go farther off from him,<br/>
			More void of milk return they to the fold.</p>
			<p>Verily some there are that fear a hurt,<br/>
			And keep close to the shepherd; but so few,<br/>
			That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods.</p>
			<p>Now if my utterance be not indistinct,<br/>
			If thine own hearing hath attentive been,<br/>
			If thou recall to mind what I have said,</p>
			<p>In part contented shall thy wishes be;<br/>
			For thou shalt see the plant that's chipped away,<br/>
			And the rebuke that lieth in the words,</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Soon as the blessed flame had taken up<br/>
			The final word to give it utterance,<br/>
			Began the holy millstone to revolve,</p>
			<p>And in its gyre had not turned wholly round,<br/>
			Before another in a ring enclosed it,<br/>
			And motion joined to motion, song to song;</p>
			<p>Song that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,<br/>
			Our Sirens, in those dulcet clarions,<br/>
			As primal splendour that which is reflected.</p>
			<p>And as are spanned athwart a tender cloud<br/>

			That shall no more be covered with a flood,</p>
			<p>In such wise of those sempiternal roses<br/>
			The garlands twain encompassed us about,<br/>
			And thus the outer to the inner answered.</p>
			<p>After the dance, and other grand rejoicings,<br/>
			Both of the singing, and the flaming forth<br/>
			Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender,</p>
			<p>Together, at once, with one accord had stopped,<br/>
			(Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them,<br/>
			Must needs together shut and lift themselves,)</p>
			<p>Out of the heart of one of the new lights<br/>
			There came a voice, that needle to the star<br/>
			Made me appear in turning thitherward.</p>
			<p>And it began: "The love that makes me fair<br/>
			Draws me to speak about the other leader,<br/>
			By whom so well is spoken here of mine.</p>
			<p>'Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other,<br/>
			That, as they were united in their warfare,<br/>
			Together likewise may their glory shine.</p>
			<p>The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost<br/>
			So dear to arm again, behind the standard<br/>
			Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few,</p>
			<p>When the Emperor who reigneth evermore<br/>
			Provided for the host that was in peril,<br/>
			Through grace alone and not that it was worthy;</p>
			<p>And, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour<br/>
			With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word<br/>
			The straggling people were together drawn.</p>
			<p>Within that region where the sweet west wind<br/>
			Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith<br/>
			Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh,</p>
			<p>Not far off from the beating of the waves,<br/>
			Behind which in his long career the sun<br/>
			Sometimes conceals himself from every man,</p>
			<p>Is situate the fortunate Calahorra,<br/>
			Under protection of the mighty shield<br/>
			In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.</p>
			<p>Therein was born the amorous paramour<br/>
			Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,<br/>
			Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;</p>
			<p>And when it was created was his mind<br/>
			Replete with such a living energy,<br/>
			That in his mother her it made prophetic.</p>
			<p>As soon as the espousals were complete<br/>
			Between him and the Faith at holy font,<br/>
			Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,</p>
			<p>The woman, who for him had given assent,<br/>
			Saw in a dream the admirable fruit<br/>
			That issue would from him and from his heirs;</p>
			<p>And that he might be construed as he was,<br/>
			A spirit from this place went forth to name him<br/>
			With His possessive whose he wholly was.</p>
			<p>Dominic was he called; and him I speak of<br/>
			Even as of the husbandman whom Christ<br/>
			Elected to his garden to assist him.</p>
			<p>Envoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,<br/>
			For the first love made manifest in him<br/>
			Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.</p>
			<p>Silent and wakeful many a time was he<br/>
			Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,<br/>
			As if he would have said, 'For this I came.'</p>
			<p>O thou his father, Felix verily!<br/>
			O thou his mother, verily Joanna,<br/>
			If this, interpreted, means as is said!</p>
			<p>Not for the world which people toil for now<br/>
			In following Ostiense and Taddeo,<br/>
			But through his longing after the true manna,</p>
			<p>He in short time became so great a teacher,<br/>
			That he began to go about the vineyard,<br/>
			Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;</p>
			<p>And of the See, (that once was more benignant<br/>
			Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,<br/>
			But him who sits there and degenerates,)</p>
			<p>Not to dispense or two or three for six,<br/>
			Not any fortune of first vacancy,<br/>
			'Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,'</p>
			<p>He asked for, but against the errant world<br/>
			Permission to do battle for the seed,<br/>
			Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.</p>
			<p>Then with the doctrine and the will together,<br/>
			With office apostolical he moved,<br/>
			Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;</p>
			<p>And in among the shoots heretical<br/>
			His impetus with greater fury smote,<br/>
			Wherever the resistance was the greatest.</p>
			<p>Of him were made thereafter divers runnels,<br/>
			Whereby the garden catholic is watered,<br/>
			So that more living its plantations stand.</p>
			<p>If such the one wheel of the Biga was,<br/>
			In which the Holy Church itself defended<br/>
			And in the field its civic battle won,</p>
			<p>Truly full manifest should be to thee<br/>
			The excellence of the other, unto whom<br/>
			Thomas so courteous was before my coming.</p>
			<p>But still the orbit, which the highest part<br/>
			Of its circumference made, is derelict,<br/>
			So that the mould is where was once the crust.</p>
			<p>His family, that had straight forward moved<br/>
			With feet upon his footprints, are turned round<br/>
			So that they set the point upon the heel.</p>
			<p>And soon aware they will be of the harvest<br/>
			Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares<br/>
			Complain the granary is taken from them.</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Let him imagine, who would well conceive<br/>
			What now I saw, and let him while I speak<br/>
			Retain the image as a steadfast rock,</p>
			<p>The fifteen stars, that in their divers regions<br/>
			The sky enliven with a light so great<br/>
			That it transcends all clusters of the air;</p>
			<p>Let him the Wain imagine unto which<br/>
			Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,<br/>
			So that in turning of its pole it fails not;</p>
			<p>Let him the mouth imagine of the horn<br/>
			That in the point beginneth of the axis<br/>
			Round about which the primal wheel revolves,—</p>
			<p>To have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,<br/>
			Like unto that which Minos' daughter made,<br/>
			The moment when she felt the frost of death;</p>
			<p>And one to have its rays within the other,<br/>
			And both to whirl themselves in such a manner<br/>
			That one should forward go, the other backward;</p>
			<p>And he will have some shadowing forth of that<br/>
			True constellation and the double dance<br/>
			That circled round the point at which I was;</p>
			<p>Because it is as much beyond our wont,<br/>
			As swifter than the motion of the Chiana<br/>
			Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.</p>
			<p>There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,<br/>
			But in the divine nature Persons three,<br/>
			And in one person the divine and human.</p>
			<p>The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,<br/>
			And unto us those holy lights gave need,<br/>
			Growing in happiness from care to care.</p>
			<p>Then broke the silence of those saints concordant<br/>
			The light in which the admirable life<br/>
			Of God's own mendicant was told to me,</p>
			<p>And said: "Now that one straw is trodden out<br/>
			Now that its seed is garnered up already,<br/>
			Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.</p>
			<p>Into that bosom, thou believest, whence<br/>
			Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek<br/>
			Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,</p>
			<p>And into that which, by the lance transfixed,<br/>
			Before and since, such satisfaction made<br/>
			That it weighs down the balance of all sin,</p>
			<p>Whate'er of light it has to human nature<br/>
			Been lawful to possess was all infused<br/>
			By the same power that both of them created;</p>
			<p>And hence at what I said above dost wonder,<br/>
			When I narrated that no second had<br/>
			The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.</p>
			<p>Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,<br/>
			And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse<br/>
			Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.</p>
			<p>That which can die, and that which dieth not,<br/>
			Are nothing but the splendour of the idea<br/>
			Which by his love our Lord brings into being;</p>
			<p>Because that living Light, which from its fount<br/>
			Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not<br/>
			From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,</p>
			<p>Through its own goodness reunites its rays<br/>
			In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,<br/>
			Itself eternally remaining One.</p>
			<p>Thence it descends to the last potencies,<br/>
			Downward from act to act becoming such<br/>
			That only brief contingencies it makes;</p>
			<p>And these contingencies I hold to be<br/>
			Things generated, which the heaven produces<br/>
			By its own motion, with seed and without.</p>
			<p>Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,<br/>
			Remains immutable, and hence beneath<br/>
			The ideal signet more and less shines through;</p>
			<p>Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree<br/>
			After its kind bears worse and better fruit,<br/>
			And ye are born with characters diverse.</p>
			<p>If in perfection tempered were the wax,<br/>
			And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,<br/>
			The brilliance of the seal would all appear;</p>
			<p>But nature gives it evermore deficient,<br/>
			In the like manner working as the artist,<br/>
			Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.</p>
			<p>If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,<br/>
			Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,<br/>
			Perfection absolute is there acquired.</p>
			<p>Thus was of old the earth created worthy<br/>
			Of all and every animal perfection;<br/>
			And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;</p>
			<p>So that thine own opinion I commend,<br/>
			That human nature never yet has been,<br/>
			Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.</p>
			<p>Now if no farther forth I should proceed,<br/>
			'Then in what way was he without a peer?'<br/>
			Would be the first beginning of thy words.</p>
			<p>But, that may well appear what now appears not,<br/>
			Think who he was, and what occasion moved him<br/>
			To make request, when it was told him, 'Ask.'</p>
			<p>I've not so spoken that thou canst not see<br/>
			Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,<br/>
			That he might be sufficiently a king;</p>
			<p>'Twas not to know the number in which are<br/>
			The motors here above, or if 'necesse'<br/>
			With a contingent e'er 'necesse' make,</p>
			<p>'Non si est dare primum motum esse,'<br/>
			Or if in semicircle can be made<br/>
			Triangle so that it have no right angle.</p>
			<p>Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,<br/>
			A regal prudence is that peerless seeing<br/>
			In which the shaft of my intention strikes.</p>
			<p>And if on 'rose' thou turnest thy clear eyes,<br/>
			Thou'lt see that it has reference alone<br/>
			To kings who're many, and the good are rare.</p>
			<p>With this distinction take thou what I said,<br/>
			And thus it can consist with thy belief<br/>
			Of the first father and of our Delight.</p>
			<p>And lead shall this be always to thy feet,<br/>
			To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly<br/>
			Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;</p>
			<p>For very low among the fools is he<br/>
			Who affirms without distinction, or denies,<br/>
			As well in one as in the other case;</p>
			<p>Because it happens that full often bends<br/>
			Current opinion in the false direction,<br/>
			And then the feelings bind the intellect.</p>
			<p>Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,<br/>
			(Since he returneth not the same he went,)<br/>
			Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;</p>
			<p>And in the world proofs manifest thereof<br/>
			Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,<br/>
			And many who went on and knew not whither;</p>
			<p>Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools<br/>
			Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures<br/>
			In rendering distorted their straight faces.</p>
			<p>Nor yet shall people be too confident<br/>
			In judging, even as he is who doth count<br/>
			The corn in field or ever it be ripe.</p>
			<p>For I have seen all winter long the thorn<br/>
			First show itself intractable and fierce,<br/>
			And after bear the rose upon its top;</p>
			<p>And I have seen a ship direct and swift<br/>
			Run o'er the sea throughout its course entire,<br/>
			To perish at the harbour's mouth at last.</p>
			<p>Let not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think,<br/>
			Seeing one steal, another offering make,<br/>
			To see them in the arbitrament divine;</p>
			<p>For one may rise, and fall the other may."</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em">From centre unto rim, from rim to centre,<br/>
			In a round vase the water moves itself,<br/>

			<p>Into my mind upon a sudden dropped<br/>
			What I am saying, at the moment when<br/>
			Silent became the glorious life of Thomas,</p>
			<p>Because of the resemblance that was born<br/>
			Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,<br/>
			Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:</p>
			<p>"This man has need (and does not tell you so,<br/>
			Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)<br/>
			Of going to the root of one truth more.</p>
			<p>Declare unto him if the light wherewith<br/>
			Blossoms your substance shall remain with you<br/>
			Eternally the same that it is now;</p>
			<p>And if it do remain, say in what manner,<br/>
			After ye are again made visible,<br/>
			It can be that it injure not your sight."</p>
			<p>As by a greater gladness urged and drawn<br/>
			They who are dancing in a ring sometimes<br/>
			Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;</p>
			<p>So, at that orison devout and prompt,<br/>
			The holy circles a new joy displayed<br/>
			In their revolving and their wondrous song.</p>
			<p>Whoso lamenteth him that here we die<br/>
			That we may live above, has never there<br/>
			Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.</p>
			<p>The One and Two and Three who ever liveth,<br/>
			And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,<br/>
			Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,</p>
			<p>Three several times was chanted by each one<br/>
			Among those spirits, with such melody<br/>
			That for all merit it were just reward;</p>
			<p>And, in the lustre most divine of all<br/>
			The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,<br/>
			Such as perhaps the Angel's was to Mary,</p>
			<p>Answer: "As long as the festivity<br/>
			Of Paradise shall be, so long our love<br/>
			Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.</p>
			<p>Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,<br/>
			The ardour to the vision; and the vision<br/>
			Equals what grace it has above its worth.</p>
			<p>When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh<br/>
			Is reassumed, then shall our persons be<br/>
			More pleasing by their being all complete;</p>
			<p>For will increase whate'er bestows on us<br/>
			Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,<br/>
			Light which enables us to look on Him;</p>
			<p>Therefore the vision must perforce increase,<br/>
			Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,<br/>
			Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.</p>
			<p>But even as a coal that sends forth flame,<br/>
			And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it<br/>
			So that its own appearance it maintains,</p>
			<p>Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now<br/>
			Shall be o'erpowered in aspect by the flesh,<br/>
			Which still to-day the earth doth cover up;</p>
			<p>Nor can so great a splendour weary us,<br/>
			For strong will be the organs of the body<br/>
			To everything which hath the power to please us."</p>
			<p>So sudden and alert appeared to me<br/>
			Both one and the other choir to say Amen,<br/>
			That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;</p>
			<p>Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,<br/>
			The fathers, and the rest who had been dear<br/>
			Or ever they became eternal flames.</p>
			<p>And lo! all round about of equal brightness<br/>
			Arose a lustre over what was there,<br/>
			Like an horizon that is clearing up.</p>
			<p>And as at rise of early eve begin<br/>
			Along the welkin new appearances,<br/>
			So that the sight seems real and unreal,</p>
			<p>It seemed to me that new subsistences<br/>
			Began there to be seen, and make a circle<br/>
			Outside the other two circumferences.</p>
			<p>O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,<br/>
			How sudden and incandescent it became<br/>
			Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!</p>
			<p>But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling<br/>
			Appeared to me, that with the other sights<br/>
			That followed not my memory I must leave her.</p>
			<p>Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed<br/>
			The power, and I beheld myself translated<br/>
			To higher salvation with my Lady only.</p>
			<p>Well was I ware that I was more uplifted<br/>
			By the enkindled smiling of the star,<br/>
			That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.</p>
			<p>With all my heart, and in that dialect<br/>
			Which is the same in all, such holocaust<br/>
			To God I made as the new grace beseemed;</p>
			<p>And not yet from my bosom was exhausted<br/>
			The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew<br/>
			This offering was accepted and auspicious;</p>
			<p>For with so great a lustre and so red<br/>
			Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,<br/>
			I said: "O Helios who dost so adorn them!"</p>
			<p>Even as distinct with less and greater lights<br/>
			Glimmers between the two poles of the world<br/>
			The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,</p>
			<p>Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,<br/>
			Those rays described the venerable sign<br/>
			That quadrants joining in a circle make.</p>
			<p>Here doth my memory overcome my genius;<br/>
			For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,<br/>
			So that I cannot find ensample worthy;</p>
			<p>But he who takes his cross and follows Christ<br/>
			Again will pardon me what I omit,<br/>
			Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.</p>
			<p>From horn to horn, and 'twixt the top and base,<br/>
			Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating<br/>
			As they together met and passed each other;</p>
			<p>Thus level and aslant and swift and slow<br/>
			We here behold, renewing still the sight,<br/>
			The particles of bodies long and short,</p>
			<p>Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed<br/>
			Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence<br/>
			People with cunning and with art contrive.</p>
			<p>And as a lute and harp, accordant strung<br/>
			With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make<br/>
			To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,</p>
			<p>So from the lights that there to me appeared<br/>
			Upgathered through the cross a melody,<br/>
			Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.</p>
			<p>Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,<br/>
			Because there came to me, "Arise and conquer!"<br/>
			As unto him who hears and comprehends not.</p>
			<p>So much enamoured I became therewith,<br/>
			That until then there was not anything<br/>
			That e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.</p>
			<p>Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,<br/>
			Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,<br/>
			Into which gazing my desire has rest;</p>
			<p>But who bethinks him that the living seals<br/>
			Of every beauty grow in power ascending,<br/>
			And that I there had not turned round to those,</p>
			<p>Can me excuse, if I myself accuse<br/>
			To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:<br/>
			For here the holy joy is not disclosed,</p>
			<p>Because ascending it becomes more pure.</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 2em">A will benign, in which reveals itself<br/>

			That Heaven's right hand doth tighten and relax.</p>
			<p>How unto just entreaties shall be deaf<br/>
			Those substances, which, to give me desire<br/>
			Of praying them, with one accord grew silent?</p>
			<p>'Tis well that without end he should lament,<br/>

			Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!"</p>
			<p>And it continued: "Hunger long and grateful,<br/>
			Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume<br/>
			Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,</p>
			<p>Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light<br/>
			In which I speak to thee, by grace of her<br/>
			Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.</p>
			<p>Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass<br/>
			From Him who is the first, as from the unit,<br/>
			If that be known, ray out the five and six;</p>
			<p>And therefore who I am thou askest not,<br/>
			And why I seem more joyous unto thee<br/>
			Than any other of this gladsome crowd.</p>
			<p>Thou think'st the truth; because the small and great<br/>
			Of this existence look into the mirror<br/>
			Wherein, before thou think'st, thy thought thou showest.</p>
			<p>But that the sacred love, in which I watch<br/>
			With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst<br/>
			With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,</p>
			<p>Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad<br/>
			Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,<br/>
			To which my answer is decreed already."</p>
			<p>To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard<br/>
			Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,<br/>
			That made the wings of my desire increase;</p>
			<p>Then in this wise began I: "Love and knowledge,<br/>
			When on you dawned the first Equality,<br/>
			Of the same weight for each of you became;</p>
			<p>For in the Sun, which lighted you and burned<br/>
			With heat and radiance, they so equal are,<br/>
			That all similitudes are insufficient.</p>
			<p>But among mortals will and argument,<br/>
			For reason that to you is manifest,<br/>
			Diversely feathered in their pinions are.</p>
			<p>Whence I, who mortal am, feel in myself<br/>
			This inequality; so give not thanks,<br/>
			Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome.</p>
			<p>Truly do I entreat thee, living topaz!<br/>
			Set in this precious jewel as a gem,<br/>
			That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name."</p>
			<p>"O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took<br/>
			E'en while awaiting, I was thine own root!"<br/>
			Such a beginning he in answer made me.</p>
			<p>Then said to me: "That one from whom is named<br/>
			Thy race, and who a hundred years and more<br/>
			Has circled round the mount on the first cornice,</p>
			<p>A son of mine and thy great-grandsire was;<br/>
			Well it behoves thee that the long fatigue<br/>
			Thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works.</p>
			<p>Florence, within the ancient boundary<br/>
			From which she taketh still her tierce and nones,<br/>
			Abode in quiet, temperate and chaste.</p>
			<p>No golden chain she had, nor coronal,<br/>
			Nor ladies shod with sandal shoon, nor girdle<br/>
			That caught the eye more than the person did.</p>
			<p>Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear<br/>
			Into the father, for the time and dower<br/>
			Did not o'errun this side or that the measure.</p>
			<p>No houses had she void of families,<br/>
			Not yet had thither come Sardanapalus<br/>
			To show what in a chamber can be done;</p>
			<p>Not yet surpassed had Montemalo been<br/>
			By your Uccellatojo, which surpassed<br/>
			Shall in its downfall be as in its rise.</p>
			<p>Bellincion Berti saw I go begirt<br/>
			With leather and with bone, and from the mirror<br/>
			His dame depart without a painted face;</p>
			<p>And him of Nerli saw, and him of Vecchio,<br/>
			Contented with their simple suits of buff<br/>
			And with the spindle and the flax their dames.</p>
			<p>O fortunate women! and each one was certain<br/>
			Of her own burial-place, and none as yet<br/>
			For sake of France was in her bed deserted.</p>
			<p>One o'er the cradle kept her studious watch,<br/>
			And in her lullaby the language used<br/>
			That first delights the fathers and the mothers;</p>
			<p>Another, drawing tresses from her distaff,<br/>
			Told o'er among her family the tales<br/>
			Of Trojans and of Fesole and Rome.</p>
			<p>As great a marvel then would have been held<br/>
			A Lapo Salterello, a Cianghella,<br/>
			As Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.</p>
			<p>To such a quiet, such a beautiful<br/>
			Life of the citizen, to such a safe<br/>
			Community, and to so sweet an inn,</p>
			<p>Did Mary give me, with loud cries invoked,<br/>
			And in your ancient Baptistery at once<br/>
			Christian and Cacciaguida I became.</p>
			<p>Moronto was my brother, and Eliseo;<br/>
			From Val di Pado came to me my wife,<br/>
			And from that place thy surname was derived.</p>
			<p>I followed afterward the Emperor Conrad,<br/>
			And he begirt me of his chivalry,<br/>
			So much I pleased him with my noble deeds.</p>
			<p>I followed in his train against that law's<br/>
			Iniquity, whose people doth usurp<br/>
			Your just possession, through your Pastor's fault.</p>
			<p>There by that execrable race was I<br/>
			Released from bonds of the fallacious world,<br/>
			The love of which defileth many souls,</p>
			<p>And came from martyrdom unto this peace."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XVI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">O thou our poor nobility of blood,<br/>
			If thou dost make the people glory in thee<br/>
			Down here where our affection languishes,</p>
			<p>A marvellous thing it ne'er will be to me;<br/>
			For there where appetite is not perverted,<br/>
			I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast!</p>
			<p>Truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,<br/>
			So that unless we piece thee day by day<br/>
			Time goeth round about thee with his shears!</p>
			<p>With 'You,' which Rome was first to tolerate,<br/>
			(Wherein her family less perseveres,)<br/>
			Yet once again my words beginning made;</p>
			<p>Whence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart,<br/>
			Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed<br/>
			At the first failing writ of Guenever.</p>
			<p>And I began: "You are my ancestor,<br/>
			You give to me all hardihood to speak,<br/>
			You lift me so that I am more than I.</p>
			<p>So many rivulets with gladness fill<br/>
			My mind, that of itself it makes a joy<br/>
			Because it can endure this and not burst.</p>
			<p>Then tell me, my beloved root ancestral,<br/>
			Who were your ancestors, and what the years<br/>
			That in your boyhood chronicled themselves?</p>
			<p>Tell me about the sheepfold of Saint John,<br/>
			How large it was, and who the people were<br/>
			Within it worthy of the highest seats."</p>
			<p>As at the blowing of the winds a coal<br/>
			Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light<br/>
			Become resplendent at my blandishments.</p>
			<p>And as unto mine eyes it grew more fair,<br/>
			With voice more sweet and tender, but not in<br/>
			This modern dialect, it said to me:</p>
			<p>"From uttering of the 'Ave,' till the birth<br/>
			In which my mother, who is now a saint,<br/>
			Of me was lightened who had been her burden,</p>
			<p>Unto its Lion had this fire returned<br/>
			Five hundred fifty times and thirty more,<br/>
			To reinflame itself beneath his paw.</p>
			<p>My ancestors and I our birthplace had<br/>
			Where first is found the last ward of the city<br/>
			By him who runneth in your annual game.</p>
			<p>Suffice it of my elders to hear this;<br/>
			But who they were, and whence they thither came,<br/>
			Silence is more considerate than speech.</p>
			<p>All those who at that time were there between<br/>
			Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms,<br/>
			Were a fifth part of those who now are living;</p>
			<p>But the community, that now is mixed<br/>
			With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine,<br/>
			Pure in the lowest artisan was seen.</p>
			<p>O how much better 'twere to have as neighbours<br/>
			The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo<br/>
			And at Trespiano have your boundary,</p>
			<p>Than have them in the town, and bear the stench<br/>
			Of Aguglione's churl, and him of Signa<br/>
			Who has sharp eyes for trickery already.</p>
			<p>Had not the folk, which most of all the world<br/>
			Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar,<br/>
			But as a mother to her son benignant,</p>
			<p>Some who turn Florentines, and trade and discount,<br/>
			Would have gone back again to Simifonte<br/>
			There where their grandsires went about as beggars.</p>
			<p>At Montemurlo still would be the Counts,<br/>
			The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,<br/>
			Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.</p>
			<p>Ever the intermingling of the people<br/>
			Has been the source of malady in cities,<br/>
			As in the body food it surfeits on;</p>
			<p>And a blind bull more headlong plunges down<br/>
			Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts<br/>
			Better and more a single sword than five.</p>
			<p>If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,<br/>
			How they have passed away, and how are passing<br/>
			Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,</p>
			<p>To hear how races waste themselves away,<br/>
			Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,<br/>
			Seeing that even cities have an end.</p>
			<p>All things of yours have their mortality,<br/>
			Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some<br/>
			That a long while endure, and lives are short;</p>
			<p>And as the turning of the lunar heaven<br/>
			Covers and bares the shores without a pause,<br/>
			In the like manner fortune does with Florence.</p>
			<p>Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing<br/>
			What I shall say of the great Florentines<br/>
			Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.</p>
			<p>I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,<br/>
			Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,<br/>
			Even in their fall illustrious citizens;</p>
			<p>And saw, as mighty as they ancient were,<br/>
			With him of La Sannella him of Arca,<br/>
			And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.</p>
			<p>Near to the gate that is at present laden<br/>
			With a new felony of so much weight<br/>
			That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,</p>
			<p>The Ravignani were, from whom descended<br/>
			The County Guido, and whoe'er the name<br/>
			Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.</p>
			<p>He of La Pressa knew the art of ruling<br/>
			Already, and already Galigajo<br/>
			Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.</p>
			<p>Mighty already was the Column Vair,<br/>
			Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,<br/>
			And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.</p>
			<p>The stock from which were the Calfucci born<br/>
			Was great already, and already chosen<br/>
			To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.</p>
			<p>O how beheld I those who are undone<br/>
			By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold<br/>
			Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!</p>
			<p>So likewise did the ancestors of those<br/>
			Who evermore, when vacant is your church,<br/>
			Fatten by staying in consistory.</p>
			<p>The insolent race, that like a dragon follows<br/>
			Whoever flees, and unto him that shows<br/>
			His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,</p>
			<p>Already rising was, but from low people;<br/>
			So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato<br/>
			That his wife's father should make him their kin.</p>
			<p>Already had Caponsacco to the Market<br/>
			From Fesole descended, and already<br/>
			Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.</p>
			<p>I'll tell a thing incredible, but true;<br/>
			One entered the small circuit by a gate<br/>
			Which from the Della Pera took its name!</p>
			<p>Each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon<br/>
			Of the great baron whose renown and name<br/>
			The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,</p>
			<p>Knighthood and privilege from him received;<br/>
			Though with the populace unites himself<br/>
			To-day the man who binds it with a border.</p>
			<p>Already were Gualterotti and Importuni;<br/>
			And still more quiet would the Borgo be<br/>
			If with new neighbours it remained unfed.</p>
			<p>The house from which is born your lamentation,<br/>
			Through just disdain that death among you brought<br/>
			And put an end unto your joyous life,</p>
			<p>Was honoured in itself and its companions.<br/>
			O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour<br/>
			Thou fled'st the bridal at another's promptings!</p>
			<p>Many would be rejoicing who are sad,<br/>
			If God had thee surrendered to the Ema<br/>
			The first time that thou camest to the city.</p>
			<p>But it behoved the mutilated stone<br/>
			Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide<br/>
			A victim in her latest hour of peace.</p>
			<p>With all these families, and others with them,<br/>
			Florence beheld I in so great repose,<br/>
			That no occasion had she whence to weep;</p>
			<p>With all these families beheld so just<br/>
			And glorious her people, that the lily<br/>
			Never upon the spear was placed reversed,</p>
			<p>Nor by division was vermilion made."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XVII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">As came to Clymene, to be made certain<br/>
			Of that which he had heard against himself,<br/>
			He who makes fathers chary still to children,</p>
			<p>Even such was I, and such was I perceived<br/>
			By Beatrice and by the holy light<br/>
			That first on my account had changed its place.</p>
			<p>Therefore my Lady said to me: "Send forth<br/>
			The flame of thy desire, so that it issue<br/>
			Imprinted well with the internal stamp;</p>
			<p>Not that our knowledge may be greater made<br/>
			By speech of thine, but to accustom thee<br/>
			To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink."</p>
			<p>"O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,<br/>
			That even as minds terrestrial perceive<br/>
			No triangle containeth two obtuse,</p>
			<p>So thou beholdest the contingent things<br/>
			Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes<br/>
			Upon the point in which all times are present,)</p>
			<p>While I was with Virgilius conjoined<br/>
			Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,<br/>
			And when descending into the dead world,</p>
			<p>Were spoken to me of my future life<br/>
			Some grievous words; although I feel myself<br/>
			In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.</p>
			<p>On this account my wish would be content<br/>
			To hear what fortune is approaching me,<br/>
			Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly."</p>
			<p>Thus did I say unto that selfsame light<br/>
			That unto me had spoken before; and even<br/>
			As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.</p>
			<p>Not in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk<br/>
			Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain<br/>
			The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,</p>
			<p>But with clear words and unambiguous<br/>
			Language responded that paternal love,<br/>
			Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:</p>
			<p>"Contingency, that outside of the volume<br/>
			Of your materiality extends not,<br/>
			Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.</p>
			<p>Necessity however thence it takes not,<br/>
			Except as from the eye, in which 'tis mirrored,<br/>
			A ship that with the current down descends.</p>
			<p>From thence, e'en as there cometh to the ear<br/>
			Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight<br/>
			To me the time that is preparing for thee.</p>
			<p>As forth from Athens went Hippolytus,<br/>
			By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,<br/>
			So thou from Florence must perforce depart.</p>
			<p>Already this is willed, and this is sought for;<br/>
			And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,<br/>
			Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.</p>
			<p>The blame shall follow the offended party<br/>
			In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance<br/>
			Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.</p>
			<p>Thou shalt abandon everything beloved<br/>
			Most tenderly, and this the arrow is<br/>
			Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.</p>
			<p>Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt<br/>
			The bread of others, and how hard a road<br/>
			The going down and up another's stairs.</p>
			<p>And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders<br/>
			Will be the bad and foolish company<br/>
			With which into this valley thou shalt fall;</p>
			<p>For all ingrate, all mad and impious<br/>
			Will they become against thee; but soon after<br/>
			They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.</p>
			<p>Of their bestiality their own proceedings<br/>
			Shall furnish proof; so 'twill be well for thee<br/>
			A party to have made thee by thyself.</p>
			<p>Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn<br/>
			Shall be the mighty Lombard's courtesy,<br/>
			Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,</p>
			<p>Who such benign regard shall have for thee<br/>
			That 'twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,<br/>
			That shall be first which is with others last.</p>
			<p>With him shalt thou see one who at his birth<br/>
			Has by this star of strength been so impressed,<br/>
			That notable shall his achievements be.</p>
			<p>Not yet the people are aware of him<br/>
			Through his young age, since only nine years yet<br/>
			Around about him have these wheels revolved.</p>
			<p>But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,<br/>
			Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear<br/>
			In caring not for silver nor for toil.</p>
			<p>So recognized shall his magnificence<br/>
			Become hereafter, that his enemies<br/>
			Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.</p>
			<p>On him rely, and on his benefits;<br/>
			By him shall many people be transformed,<br/>
			Changing condition rich and mendicant;</p>
			<p>And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear<br/>
			Of him, but shalt not say it"—and things said he<br/>
			Incredible to those who shall be present.</p>
			<p>Then added: "Son, these are the commentaries<br/>
			On what was said to thee; behold the snares<br/>
			That are concealed behind few revolutions;</p>
			<p>Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,<br/>
			Because thy life into the future reaches<br/>
			Beyond the punishment of their perfidies."</p>
			<p>When by its silence showed that sainted soul<br/>
			That it had finished putting in the woof<br/>
			Into that web which I had given it warped,</p>
			<p>Began I, even as he who yearneth after,<br/>
			Being in doubt, some counsel from a person<br/>
			Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:</p>
			<p>"Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on<br/>
			The time towards me such a blow to deal me<br/>
			As heaviest is to him who most gives way.</p>
			<p>Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,<br/>
			That, if the dearest place be taken from me,<br/>
			I may not lose the others by my songs.</p>
			<p>Down through the world of infinite bitterness,<br/>
			And o'er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit<br/>
			The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,</p>
			<p>And afterward through heaven from light to light,<br/>
			I have learned that which, if I tell again,<br/>
			Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.</p>
			<p>And if I am a timid friend to truth,<br/>
			I fear lest I may lose my life with those<br/>
			Who will hereafter call this time the olden."</p>
			<p>The light in which was smiling my own treasure<br/>
			Which there I had discovered, flashed at first<br/>
			As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;</p>
			<p>Then made reply: "A conscience overcast<br/>
			Or with its own or with another's shame,<br/>
			Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;</p>
			<p>But ne'ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,<br/>
			Make manifest thy vision utterly,<br/>
			And let them scratch wherever is the itch;</p>
			<p>For if thine utterance shall offensive be<br/>
			At the first taste, a vital nutriment<br/>
			'Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.</p>
			<p>This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,<br/>
			Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,<br/>
			And that is no slight argument of honour.</p>
			<p>Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,<br/>
			Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,<br/>
			Only the souls that unto fame are known;</p>
			<p>Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,<br/>
			Nor doth confirm its faith by an example<br/>
			Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,</p>
			<p>Or other reason that is not apparent."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XVIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Now was alone rejoicing in its word<br/>
			That soul beatified, and I was tasting<br/>
			My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,</p>
			<p>And the Lady who to God was leading me<br/>
			Said: "Change thy thought; consider that I am<br/>
			Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens."</p>
			<p>Unto the loving accents of my comfort<br/>
			I turned me round, and then what love I saw<br/>
			Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;</p>
			<p>Not only that my language I distrust,<br/>
			But that my mind cannot return so far<br/>
			Above itself, unless another guide it.</p>
			<p>Thus much upon that point can I repeat,<br/>
			That, her again beholding, my affection<br/>
			From every other longing was released.</p>
			<p>While the eternal pleasure, which direct<br/>
			Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face<br/>
			Contented me with its reflected aspect,</p>
			<p>Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,<br/>
			She said to me, "Turn thee about and listen;<br/>
			Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise."</p>
			<p>Even as sometimes here do we behold<br/>
			The affection in the look, if it be such<br/>
			That all the soul is wrapt away by it,</p>
			<p>So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy<br/>
			To which I turned, I recognized therein<br/>
			The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.</p>
			<p>And it began: "In this fifth resting-place<br/>
			Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,<br/>
			And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,</p>
			<p>Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet<br/>
			They came to Heaven, were of such great renown<br/>
			That every Muse therewith would affluent be.</p>
			<p>Therefore look thou upon the cross's horns;<br/>
			He whom I now shall name will there enact<br/>
			What doth within a cloud its own swift fire."</p>
			<p>I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn<br/>
			By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)<br/>
			Nor noted I the word before the deed;</p>
			<p>And at the name of the great Maccabee<br/>
			I saw another move itself revolving,<br/>
			And gladness was the whip unto that top.</p>
			<p>Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,<br/>
			Two of them my regard attentive followed<br/>
			As followeth the eye its falcon flying.</p>
			<p>William thereafterward, and Renouard,<br/>
			And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight<br/>
			Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.</p>
			<p>Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,<br/>
			The soul that had addressed me showed how great<br/>
			An artist 'twas among the heavenly singers.</p>
			<p>To my right side I turned myself around,<br/>
			My duty to behold in Beatrice<br/>
			Either by words or gesture signified;</p>
			<p>And so translucent I beheld her eyes,<br/>
			So full of pleasure, that her countenance<br/>
			Surpassed its other and its latest wont.</p>
			<p>And as, by feeling greater delectation,<br/>
			A man in doing good from day to day<br/>
			Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,</p>
			<p>So I became aware that my gyration<br/>
			With heaven together had increased its arc,<br/>
			That miracle beholding more adorned.</p>
			<p>And such as is the change, in little lapse<br/>
			Of time, in a pale woman, when her face<br/>
			Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,</p>
			<p>Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,<br/>
			Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,<br/>
			The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.</p>
			<p>Within that Jovial torch did I behold<br/>
			The sparkling of the love which was therein<br/>
			Delineate our language to mine eyes.</p>
			<p>And even as birds uprisen from the shore,<br/>
			As in congratulation o'er their food,<br/>
			Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,</p>
			<p>So from within those lights the holy creatures<br/>
			Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures<br/>
			Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.</p>
			<p>First singing they to their own music moved;<br/>
			Then one becoming of these characters,<br/>
			A little while they rested and were silent.</p>
			<p>O divine Pegasea, thou who genius<br/>
			Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,<br/>
			And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,</p>
			<p>Illume me with thyself, that I may bring<br/>
			Their figures out as I have them conceived!<br/>
			Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!</p>
			<p>Themselves then they displayed in five times seven<br/>
			Vowels and consonants; and I observed<br/>
			The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.</p>
			<p>'Diligite justitiam,' these were<br/>
			First verb and noun of all that was depicted;<br/>
			'Qui judicatis terram' were the last.</p>
			<p>Thereafter in the M of the fifth word<br/>
			Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter<br/>
			Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.</p>
			<p>And other lights I saw descend where was<br/>
			The summit of the M, and pause there singing<br/>
			The good, I think, that draws them to itself.</p>
			<p>Then, as in striking upon burning logs<br/>
			Upward there fly innumerable sparks,<br/>
			Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,</p>
			<p>More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,<br/>
			And to ascend, some more, and others less,<br/>
			Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;</p>
			<p>And, each one being quiet in its place,<br/>
			The head and neck beheld I of an eagle<br/>
			Delineated by that inlaid fire.</p>
			<p>He who there paints has none to be his guide;<br/>
			But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered<br/>
			That virtue which is form unto the nest.</p>

			By a slight motion followed out the imprint.</p>
			<p>O gentle star! what and how many gems<br/>
			Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice<br/>
			Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!</p>
			<p>Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin<br/>
			Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard<br/>
			Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;</p>
			<p>So that a second time it now be wroth<br/>
			With buying and with selling in the temple<br/>
			Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!</p>
			<p>O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,<br/>
			Implore for those who are upon the earth<br/>
			All gone astray after the bad example!</p>
			<p>Once 'twas the custom to make war with swords;<br/>
			But now 'tis made by taking here and there<br/>
			The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.</p>
			<p>Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think<br/>
			That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard<br/>
			Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!</p>
			<p>Well canst thou say: "So steadfast my desire<br/>
			Is unto him who willed to live alone,<br/>
			And for a dance was led to martyrdom,</p>
			<p>That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XIX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Appeared before me with its wings outspread<br/>
			The beautiful image that in sweet fruition<br/>
			Made jubilant the interwoven souls;</p>
			<p>Appeared a little ruby each, wherein<br/>
			Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled<br/>
			That each into mine eyes refracted it.</p>
			<p>And what it now behoves me to retrace<br/>
			Nor voice has e'er reported, nor ink written,<br/>
			Nor was by fantasy e'er comprehended;</p>
			<p>For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,<br/>
			And utter with its voice both 'I' and 'My,'<br/>
			When in conception it was 'We' and 'Our.'</p>
			<p>And it began: "Being just and merciful<br/>
			Am I exalted here unto that glory<br/>
			Which cannot be exceeded by desire;</p>
			<p>And upon earth I left my memory<br/>
			Such, that the evil-minded people there<br/>
			Commend it, but continue not the story."</p>
			<p>So doth a single heat from many embers<br/>
			Make itself felt, even as from many loves<br/>
			Issued a single sound from out that image.</p>
			<p>Whence I thereafter: "O perpetual flowers<br/>
			Of the eternal joy, that only one<br/>
			Make me perceive your odours manifold,</p>
			<p>Exhaling, break within me the great fast<br/>
			Which a long season has in hunger held me,<br/>
			Not finding for it any food on earth.</p>
			<p>Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror<br/>
			Justice Divine another realm doth make,<br/>
			Yours apprehends it not through any veil.</p>
			<p>You know how I attentively address me<br/>
			To listen; and you know what is the doubt<br/>
			That is in me so very old a fast."</p>
			<p>Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,<br/>
			Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,<br/>
			Showing desire, and making himself fine,</p>
			<p>Saw I become that standard, which of lauds<br/>
			Was interwoven of the grace divine,<br/>
			With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.</p>
			<p>Then it began: "He who a compass turned<br/>
			On the world's outer verge, and who within it<br/>
			Devised so much occult and manifest,</p>
			<p>Could not the impress of his power so make<br/>
			On all the universe, as that his Word<br/>
			Should not remain in infinite excess.</p>
			<p>And this makes certain that the first proud being,<br/>
			Who was the paragon of every creature,<br/>
			By not awaiting light fell immature.</p>
			<p>And hence appears it, that each minor nature<br/>
			Is scant receptacle unto that good<br/>
			Which has no end, and by itself is measured.</p>
			<p>In consequence our vision, which perforce<br/>
			Must be some ray of that intelligence<br/>
			With which all things whatever are replete,</p>
			<p>Cannot in its own nature be so potent,<br/>
			That it shall not its origin discern<br/>
			Far beyond that which is apparent to it.</p>
			<p>Therefore into the justice sempiternal<br/>
			The power of vision that your world receives,<br/>
			As eye into the ocean, penetrates;</p>
			<p>Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,<br/>
			Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet<br/>
			'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.</p>
			<p>There is no light but comes from the serene<br/>
			That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness<br/>
			Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.</p>
			<p>Amply to thee is opened now the cavern<br/>
			Which has concealed from thee the living justice<br/>
			Of which thou mad'st such frequent questioning.</p>
			<p>For saidst thou: 'Born a man is on the shore<br/>
			Of Indus, and is none who there can speak<br/>
			Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;</p>
			<p>And all his inclinations and his actions<br/>
			Are good, so far as human reason sees,<br/>
			Without a sin in life or in discourse:</p>
			<p>He dieth unbaptised and without faith;<br/>
			Where is this justice that condemneth him?<br/>
			Where is his fault, if he do not believe?'</p>
			<p>Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit<br/>
			In judgment at a thousand miles away,<br/>
			With the short vision of a single span?</p>
			<p>Truly to him who with me subtilizes,<br/>
			If so the Scripture were not over you,<br/>
			For doubting there were marvellous occasion.</p>
			<p>O animals terrene, O stolid minds,<br/>
			The primal will, that in itself is good,<br/>
			Ne'er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.</p>
			<p>So much is just as is accordant with it;<br/>
			No good created draws it to itself,<br/>
			But it, by raying forth, occasions that."</p>
			<p>Even as above her nest goes circling round<br/>
			The stork when she has fed her little ones,<br/>
			And he who has been fed looks up at her,</p>
			<p>So lifted I my brows, and even such<br/>
			Became the blessed image, which its wings<br/>
			Was moving, by so many counsels urged.</p>
			<p>Circling around it sang, and said: "As are<br/>
			My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,<br/>
			Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals."</p>
			<p>Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit<br/>
			Grew quiet then, but still within the standard<br/>
			That made the Romans reverend to the world.</p>
			<p>It recommenced: "Unto this kingdom never<br/>
			Ascended one who had not faith in Christ,<br/>
			Before or since he to the tree was nailed.</p>
			<p>But look thou, many crying are, 'Christ, Christ!'<br/>
			Who at the judgment shall be far less near<br/>
			To him than some shall be who knew not Christ.</p>
			<p>Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn,<br/>
			When the two companies shall be divided,<br/>
			The one for ever rich, the other poor.</p>
			<p>What to your kings may not the Persians say,<br/>
			When they that volume opened shall behold<br/>
			In which are written down all their dispraises?</p>
			<p>There shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert,<br/>
			That which ere long shall set the pen in motion,<br/>
			For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted.</p>
			<p>There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine<br/>
			He brings by falsifying of the coin,<br/>
			Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die.</p>
			<p>There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst,<br/>
			Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad<br/>
			That they within their boundaries cannot rest;</p>
			<p>Be seen the luxury and effeminate life<br/>
			Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian,<br/>
			Who valour never knew and never wished;</p>
			<p>Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem,<br/>
			His goodness represented by an I,<br/>
			While the reverse an M shall represent;</p>
			<p>Be seen the avarice and poltroonery<br/>
			Of him who guards the Island of the Fire,<br/>
			Wherein Anchises finished his long life;</p>
			<p>And to declare how pitiful he is<br/>
			Shall be his record in contracted letters<br/>
			Which shall make note of much in little space.</p>
			<p>And shall appear to each one the foul deeds<br/>
			Of uncle and of brother who a nation<br/>
			So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns.</p>
			<p>And he of Portugal and he of Norway<br/>
			Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too,<br/>
			Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice.</p>
			<p>O happy Hungary, if she let herself<br/>
			Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy,<br/>
			If with the hills that gird her she be armed!</p>
			<p>And each one may believe that now, as hansel<br/>
			Thereof, do Nicosia and Famagosta<br/>
			Lament and rage because of their own beast,</p>
			<p>Who from the others' flank departeth not."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">When he who all the world illuminates<br/>

			That on all sides the daylight is consumed,</p>
			<p>The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled,<br/>
			Doth suddenly reveal itself again<br/>
			By many lights, wherein is one resplendent.</p>
			<p>And came into my mind this act of heaven,<br/>
			When the ensign of the world and of its leaders<br/>
			Had silent in the blessed beak become;</p>
			<p>Because those living luminaries all,<br/>
			By far more luminous, did songs begin<br/>
			Lapsing and falling from my memory.</p>
			<p>O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,<br/>
			How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,<br/>
			That had the breath alone of holy thoughts!</p>
			<p>After the precious and pellucid crystals,<br/>
			With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld,<br/>
			Silence imposed on the angelic bells,</p>
			<p>I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river<br/>
			That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,<br/>
			Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.</p>
			<p>And as the sound upon the cithern's neck<br/>
			Taketh its form, and as upon the vent<br/>
			Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,</p>
			<p>Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,<br/>
			That murmuring of the eagle mounted up<br/>
			Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.</p>
			<p>There it became a voice, and issued thence<br/>
			From out its beak, in such a form of words<br/>
			As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them.</p>
			<p>"The part in me which sees and bears the sun<br/>
			In mortal eagles," it began to me,<br/>
			"Now fixedly must needs be looked upon;</p>
			<p>For of the fires of which I make my figure,<br/>
			Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head<br/>
			Of all their orders the supremest are.</p>
			<p>He who is shining in the midst as pupil<br/>
			Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit,<br/>
			Who bore the ark from city unto city;</p>
			<p>Now knoweth he the merit of his song,<br/>
			In so far as effect of his own counsel,<br/>
			By the reward which is commensurate.</p>
			<p>Of five, that make a circle for my brow,<br/>
			He that approacheth nearest to my beak<br/>
			Did the poor widow for her son console;</p>
			<p>Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost<br/>
			Not following Christ, by the experience<br/>
			Of this sweet life and of its opposite.</p>
			<p>He who comes next in the circumference<br/>
			Of which I speak, upon its highest arc,<br/>
			Did death postpone by penitence sincere;</p>
			<p>Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment<br/>
			Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer<br/>
			Maketh below to-morrow of to-day.</p>
			<p>The next who follows, with the laws and me,<br/>
			Under the good intent that bore bad fruit<br/>
			Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor;</p>
			<p>Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced<br/>
			From his good action is not harmful to him,<br/>
			Although the world thereby may be destroyed.</p>
			<p>And he, whom in the downward arc thou seest,<br/>
			Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores<br/>
			That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive;</p>
			<p>Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is<br/>
			With a just king; and in the outward show<br/>
			Of his effulgence he reveals it still.</p>
			<p>Who would believe, down in the errant world,<br/>
			That e'er the Trojan Ripheus in this round<br/>
			Could be the fifth one of the holy lights?</p>
			<p>Now knoweth he enough of what the world<br/>
			Has not the power to see of grace divine,<br/>
			Although his sight may not discern the bottom."</p>
			<p>Like as a lark that in the air expatiates,<br/>
			First singing and then silent with content<br/>
			Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her,</p>
			<p>Such seemed to me the image of the imprint<br/>
			Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will<br/>
			Doth everything become the thing it is.</p>
			<p>And notwithstanding to my doubt I was<br/>
			As glass is to the colour that invests it,<br/>
			To wait the time in silence it endured not,</p>
			<p>But forth from out my mouth, "What things are these?"<br/>
			Extorted with the force of its own weight;<br/>
			Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation.</p>
			<p>Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled<br/>
			The blessed standard made to me reply,<br/>
			To keep me not in wonderment suspended:</p>
			<p>"I see that thou believest in these things<br/>
			Because I say them, but thou seest not how;<br/>
			So that, although believed in, they are hidden.</p>
			<p>Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name<br/>
			Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity<br/>
			Cannot perceive, unless another show it.</p>
			<p>'Regnum coelorum' suffereth violence<br/>
			From fervent love, and from that living hope<br/>
			That overcometh the Divine volition;</p>
			<p>Not in the guise that man o'ercometh man,<br/>
			But conquers it because it will be conquered,<br/>
			And conquered conquers by benignity.</p>
			<p>The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth<br/>
			Cause thee astonishment, because with them<br/>
			Thou seest the region of the angels painted.</p>
			<p>They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,<br/>
			Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith<br/>
			Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.</p>
			<p>For one from Hell, where no one e'er turns back<br/>
			Unto good will, returned unto his bones,<br/>
			And that of living hope was the reward,—</p>
			<p>Of living hope, that placed its efficacy<br/>
			In prayers to God made to resuscitate him,<br/>
			So that 'twere possible to move his will.</p>
			<p>The glorious soul concerning which I speak,<br/>
			Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,<br/>
			Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;</p>
			<p>And, in believing, kindled to such fire<br/>
			Of genuine love, that at the second death<br/>
			Worthy it was to come unto this joy.</p>
			<p>The other one, through grace, that from so deep<br/>
			A fountain wells that never hath the eye<br/>
			Of any creature reached its primal wave,</p>
			<p>Set all his love below on righteousness;<br/>
			Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose<br/>
			His eye to our redemption yet to be,</p>
			<p>Whence he believed therein, and suffered not<br/>
			From that day forth the stench of paganism,<br/>
			And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.</p>
			<p>Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel<br/>
			Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism<br/>
			More than a thousand years before baptizing.</p>
			<p>O thou predestination, how remote<br/>
			Thy root is from the aspect of all those<br/>
			Who the First Cause do not behold entire!</p>
			<p>And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained<br/>
			In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,<br/>
			We do not know as yet all the elect;</p>
			<p>And sweet to us is such a deprivation,<br/>
			Because our good in this good is made perfect,<br/>
			That whatsoe'er God wills, we also will."</p>
			<p>After this manner by that shape divine,<br/>
			To make clear in me my short-sightedness,<br/>
			Was given to me a pleasant medicine;</p>
			<p>And as good singer a good lutanist<br/>
			Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,<br/>
			Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,</p>
			<p>So, while it spake, do I remember me<br/>
			That I beheld both of those blessed lights,<br/>
			Even as the winking of the eyes concords,</p>
			<p>Moving unto the words their little flames.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Already on my Lady's face mine eyes<br/>
			Again were fastened, and with these my mind,<br/>
			And from all other purpose was withdrawn;</p>
			<p>And she smiled not; but "If I were to smile,"<br/>

			Like Semele, when she was turned to ashes.</p>
			<p>Because my beauty, that along the stairs<br/>
			Of the eternal palace more enkindles,<br/>
			As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend,</p>
			<p>If it were tempered not, is so resplendent<br/>
			That all thy mortal power in its effulgence<br/>

			Now radiates downward mingled with his power.</p>
			<p>Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind,<br/>

			<p>He who could know what was the pasturage<br/>
			My sight had in that blessed countenance,<br/>
			When I transferred me to another care,</p>
			<p>Would recognize how grateful was to me<br/>
			Obedience unto my celestial escort,<br/>
			By counterpoising one side with the other.</p>
			<p>Within the crystal which, around the world<br/>
			Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader,<br/>
			Under whom every wickedness lay dead,</p>
			<p>Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams,<br/>
			A stairway I beheld to such a height<br/>
			Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.</p>
			<p>Likewise beheld I down the steps descending<br/>
			So many splendours, that I thought each light<br/>
			That in the heaven appears was there diffused.</p>
			<p>And as accordant with their natural custom<br/>
			The rooks together at the break of day<br/>
			Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;</p>
			<p>Then some of them fly off without return,<br/>
			Others come back to where they started from,<br/>
			And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;</p>
			<p>Such fashion it appeared to me was there<br/>
			Within the sparkling that together came,<br/>
			As soon as on a certain step it struck,</p>
			<p>And that which nearest unto us remained<br/>
			Became so clear, that in my thought I said,<br/>
			"Well I perceive the love thou showest me;</p>
			<p>But she, from whom I wait the how and when<br/>
			Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I<br/>
			Against desire do well if I ask not."</p>
			<p>She thereupon, who saw my silentness<br/>
			In the sight of Him who seeth everything,<br/>
			Said unto me, "Let loose thy warm desire."</p>
			<p>And I began: "No merit of my own<br/>
			Renders me worthy of response from thee;<br/>
			But for her sake who granteth me the asking,</p>
			<p>Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed<br/>
			In thy beatitude, make known to me<br/>
			The cause which draweth thee so near my side;</p>
			<p>And tell me why is silent in this wheel<br/>
			The dulcet symphony of Paradise,<br/>
			That through the rest below sounds so devoutly."</p>
			<p>"Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,"<br/>
			It answer made to me; "they sing not here,<br/>
			For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.</p>
			<p>Thus far adown the holy stairway's steps<br/>
			Have I descended but to give thee welcome<br/>
			With words, and with the light that mantles me;</p>
			<p>Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,<br/>
			For love as much and more up there is burning,<br/>
			As doth the flaming manifest to thee.</p>
			<p>But the high charity, that makes us servants<br/>
			Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,<br/>
			Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe."</p>
			<p>"I see full well," said I, "O sacred lamp!<br/>
			How love unfettered in this court sufficeth<br/>
			To follow the eternal Providence;</p>
			<p>But this is what seems hard for me to see,<br/>
			Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone<br/>
			Unto this office from among thy consorts."</p>
			<p>No sooner had I come to the last word,<br/>
			Than of its middle made the light a centre,<br/>
			Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.</p>
			<p>When answer made the love that was therein:<br/>
			"On me directed is a light divine,<br/>
			Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,</p>
			<p>Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined<br/>
			Lifts me above myself so far, I see<br/>
			The supreme essence from which this is drawn.</p>
			<p>Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,<br/>
			For to my sight, as far as it is clear,<br/>
			The clearness of the flame I equal make.</p>
			<p>But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,<br/>
			That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,<br/>
			Could this demand of thine not satisfy;</p>
			<p>Because so deeply sinks in the abyss<br/>
			Of the eternal statute what thou askest,<br/>
			From all created sight it is cut off.</p>
			<p>And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,<br/>
			This carry back, that it may not presume<br/>
			Longer tow'rd such a goal to move its feet.</p>
			<p>The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;<br/>
			From this observe how can it do below<br/>
			That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?"</p>
			<p>Such limit did its words prescribe to me,<br/>
			The question I relinquished, and restricted<br/>
			Myself to ask it humbly who it was.</p>
			<p>"Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,<br/>
			And not far distant from thy native place,<br/>
			So high, the thunders far below them sound,</p>
			<p>And form a ridge that Catria is called,<br/>
			'Neath which is consecrate a hermitage<br/>
			Wont to be dedicate to worship only."</p>
			<p>Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<br/>
			And then, continuing, it said: "Therein<br/>
			Unto God's service I became so steadfast,</p>
			<p>That feeding only on the juice of olives<br/>
			Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,<br/>
			Contented in my thoughts contemplative.</p>
			<p>That cloister used to render to these heavens<br/>
			Abundantly, and now is empty grown,<br/>
			So that perforce it soon must be revealed.</p>
			<p>I in that place was Peter Damiano;<br/>
			And Peter the Sinner was I in the house<br/>
			Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.</p>
			<p>Little of mortal life remained to me,<br/>
			When I was called and dragged forth to the hat<br/>
			Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.</p>
			<p>Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came<br/>
			Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,<br/>
			Taking the food of any hostelry.</p>
			<p>Now some one to support them on each side<br/>
			The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,<br/>
			So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.</p>
			<p>They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,<br/>
			So that two beasts go underneath one skin;<br/>
			O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!"</p>
			<p>At this voice saw I many little flames<br/>
			From step to step descending and revolving,<br/>
			And every revolution made them fairer.</p>
			<p>Round about this one came they and stood still,<br/>
			And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,<br/>
			It here could find no parallel, nor I</p>
			<p>Distinguished it, the thunder so o'ercame me.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide<br/>

			<p>And she, even as a mother who straightway<br/>
			Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy<br/>
			With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,</p>
			<p>Said to me: "Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,<br/>
			And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all<br/>
			And what is done here cometh from good zeal?</p>
			<p>After what wise the singing would have changed thee<br/>
			And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,<br/>
			Since that the cry has startled thee so much,</p>
			<p>In which if thou hadst understood its prayers<br/>
			Already would be known to thee the vengeance<br/>
			Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.</p>
			<p>The sword above here smiteth not in haste<br/>
			Nor tardily, howe'er it seem to him<br/>

			<p>As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,<br/>

			<p>And now the largest and most luculent<br/>
			Among those pearls came forward, that it might<br/>

			<p>Within it then I heard: "If thou couldst see<br/>

			Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;</p>
			<p>But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late<br/>

			<p>These other fires, each one of them, were men<br/>
			Contemplative, enkindled by that heat<br/>
			Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.</p>
			<p>Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<br/>
			Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters<br/>
			Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart."</p>
			<p>And I to him: "The affection which thou showest<br/>
			Speaking with me, and the good countenance<br/>
			Which I behold and note in all your ardours,</p>
			<p>In me have so my confidence dilated<br/>
			As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes<br/>
			As far unfolded as it hath the power.</p>
			<p>Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,<br/>
			If I may so much grace receive, that I<br/>
			May thee behold with countenance unveiled."</p>
			<p>He thereupon: "Brother, thy high desire<br/>
			In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,<br/>
			Where are fulfilled all others and my own.</p>
			<p>There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,<br/>
			Every desire; within that one alone<br/>
			Is every part where it has always been;</p>
			<p>For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,<br/>
			And unto it our stairway reaches up,<br/>
			Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.</p>
			<p>Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<br/>
			Extending its supernal part, what time<br/>
			So thronged with angels it appeared to him.</p>
			<p>But to ascend it now no one uplifts<br/>
			His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule<br/>
			Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.</p>
			<p>The walls that used of old to be an Abbey<br/>
			Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls<br/>
			Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.</p>
			<p>But heavy usury is not taken up<br/>
			So much against God's pleasure as that fruit<br/>
			Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;</p>
			<p>For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping<br/>
			Is for the folk that ask it in God's name,<br/>
			Not for one's kindred or for something worse.</p>
			<p>The flesh of mortals is so very soft,<br/>
			That good beginnings down below suffice not<br/>
			From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.</p>
			<p>Peter began with neither gold nor silver,<br/>
			And I with orison and abstinence,<br/>
			And Francis with humility his convent.</p>
			<p>And if thou lookest at each one's beginning,<br/>
			And then regardest whither he has run,<br/>
			Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.</p>
			<p>In verity the Jordan backward turned,<br/>
			And the sea's fleeing, when God willed were more<br/>
			A wonder to behold, than succour here."</p>
			<p>Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew<br/>
			To his own band, and the band closed together;<br/>
			Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.</p>
			<p>The gentle Lady urged me on behind them<br/>
			Up o'er that stairway by a single sign,<br/>
			So did her virtue overcome my nature;</p>
			<p>Nor here below, where one goes up and down<br/>
			By natural law, was motion e'er so swift<br/>
			That it could be compared unto my wing.</p>
			<p>Reader, as I may unto that devout<br/>
			Triumph return, on whose account I often<br/>
			For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,—</p>
			<p>Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire<br/>
			And drawn it out again, before I saw<br/>
			The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.</p>
			<p>O glorious stars, O light impregnated<br/>
			With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge<br/>
			All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be,</p>
			<p>With you was born, and hid himself with you,<br/>
			He who is father of all mortal life,<br/>
			When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;</p>
			<p>And then when grace was freely given to me<br/>
			To enter the high wheel which turns you round,<br/>
			Your region was allotted unto me.</p>
			<p>To you devoutly at this hour my soul<br/>
			Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire<br/>
			For the stern pass that draws it to itself.</p>
			<p>"Thou art so near unto the last salvation,"<br/>
			Thus Beatrice began, "thou oughtest now<br/>
			To have thine eves unclouded and acute;</p>
			<p>And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,<br/>
			Look down once more, and see how vast a world<br/>
			Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;</p>
			<p>So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,<br/>
			Present itself to the triumphant throng<br/>
			That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether."</p>
			<p>I with my sight returned through one and all<br/>
			The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe<br/>
			Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;</p>
			<p>And that opinion I approve as best<br/>
			Which doth account it least; and he who thinks<br/>
			Of something else may truly be called just.</p>
			<p>I saw the daughter of Latona shining<br/>
			Without that shadow, which to me was cause<br/>
			That once I had believed her rare and dense.</p>
			<p>The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,<br/>
			Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves<br/>
			Around and near him Maia and Dione.</p>
			<p>Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove<br/>
			'Twixt son and father, and to me was clear<br/>
			The change that of their whereabout they make;</p>
			<p>And all the seven made manifest to me<br/>
			How great they are, and eke how swift they are,<br/>
			And how they are in distant habitations.</p>
			<p>The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,<br/>
			To me revolving with the eternal Twins,<br/>
			Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!</p>
			<p>Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Even as a bird, 'mid the beloved leaves,<br/>
			Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood<br/>
			Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,</p>
			<p>Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks<br/>
			And find the food wherewith to nourish them,<br/>
			In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,</p>
			<p>Anticipates the time on open spray<br/>
			And with an ardent longing waits the sun,<br/>
			Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:</p>
			<p>Even thus my Lady standing was, erect<br/>
			And vigilant, turned round towards the zone<br/>
			Underneath which the sun displays less haste;</p>
			<p>So that beholding her distraught and wistful,<br/>
			Such I became as he is who desiring<br/>
			For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.</p>
			<p>But brief the space from one When to the other;<br/>
			Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing<br/>
			The welkin grow resplendent more and more.</p>
			<p>And Beatrice exclaimed: "Behold the hosts<br/>
			Of Christ's triumphal march, and all the fruit<br/>
			Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!"</p>
			<p>It seemed to me her face was all aflame;<br/>
			And eyes she had so full of ecstasy<br/>
			That I must needs pass on without describing.</p>
			<p>As when in nights serene of the full moon<br/>
			Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal<br/>
			Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,</p>
			<p>Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,<br/>
			A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,<br/>
			E'en as our own doth the supernal sights,</p>
			<p>And through the living light transparent shone<br/>
			The lucent substance so intensely clear<br/>
			Into my sight, that I sustained it not.</p>
			<p>O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!<br/>
			To me she said: "What overmasters thee<br/>
			A virtue is from which naught shields itself.</p>
			<p>There are the wisdom and the omnipotence<br/>
			That oped the thoroughfares 'twixt heaven and earth,<br/>
			For which there erst had been so long a yearning."</p>
			<p>As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,<br/>
			Dilating so it finds not room therein,<br/>
			And down, against its nature, falls to earth,</p>
			<p>So did my mind, among those aliments<br/>
			Becoming larger, issue from itself,<br/>
			And that which it became cannot remember.</p>
			<p>"Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<br/>
			Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough<br/>
			Hast thou become to tolerate my smile."</p>
			<p>I was as one who still retains the feeling<br/>
			Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours<br/>
			In vain to bring it back into his mind,</p>
			<p>When I this invitation heard, deserving<br/>
			Of so much gratitude, it never fades<br/>
			Out of the book that chronicles the past.</p>
			<p>If at this moment sounded all the tongues<br/>
			That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<br/>
			Most lubrical with their delicious milk,</p>
			<p>To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth<br/>
			It would not reach, singing the holy smile<br/>
			And how the holy aspect it illumed.</p>
			<p>And therefore, representing Paradise,<br/>
			The sacred poem must perforce leap over,<br/>
			Even as a man who finds his way cut off;</p>
			<p>But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,<br/>
			And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,<br/>
			Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.</p>
			<p>It is no passage for a little boat<br/>
			This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,<br/>
			Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.</p>
			<p>"Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<br/>
			That to the garden fair thou turnest not,<br/>
			Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?</p>
			<p>There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<br/>
			Became incarnate; there the lilies are<br/>
			By whose perfume the good way was discovered."</p>
			<p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels<br/>
			Was wholly ready, once again betook me<br/>
			Unto the battle of the feeble brows.</p>
			<p>As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams<br/>
			Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers<br/>
			Mine eyes with shadow covered o'er have seen,</p>
			<p>So troops of splendours manifold I saw<br/>
			Illumined from above with burning rays,<br/>
			Beholding not the source of the effulgence.</p>
			<p>O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<br/>
			Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope<br/>
			There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.</p>
			<p>The name of that fair flower I e'er invoke<br/>
			Morning and evening utterly enthralled<br/>
			My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.</p>
			<p>And when in both mine eyes depicted were<br/>
			The glory and greatness of the living star<br/>
			Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,</p>
			<p>Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<br/>
			Formed in a circle like a coronal,<br/>
			And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.</p>
			<p>Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth<br/>
			On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,<br/>
			Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,</p>
			<p>Compared unto the sounding of that lyre<br/>
			Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<br/>
			Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.</p>
			<p>"I am Angelic Love, that circle round<br/>
			The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb<br/>
			That was the hostelry of our Desire;</p>
			<p>And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while<br/>
			Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner<br/>
			The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there."</p>
			<p>Thus did the circulated melody<br/>
			Seal itself up; and all the other lights<br/>
			Were making to resound the name of Mary.</p>
			<p>The regal mantle of the volumes all<br/>
			Of that world, which most fervid is and living<br/>
			With breath of God and with his works and ways,</p>
			<p>Extended over us its inner border,<br/>
			So very distant, that the semblance of it<br/>
			There where I was not yet appeared to me.</p>
			<p>Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power<br/>
			Of following the incoronated flame,<br/>
			Which mounted upward near to its own seed.</p>
			<p>And as a little child, that towards its mother<br/>
			Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,<br/>
			Through impulse kindled into outward flame,</p>
			<p>Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached<br/>
			So with its summit, that the deep affection<br/>
			They had for Mary was revealed to me.</p>
			<p>Thereafter they remained there in my sight,<br/>
			'Regina coeli' singing with such sweetness,<br/>
			That ne'er from me has the delight departed.</p>
			<p>O, what exuberance is garnered up<br/>
			Within those richest coffers, which had been<br/>
			Good husbandmen for sowing here below!</p>
			<p>There they enjoy and live upon the treasure<br/>
			Which was acquired while weeping in the exile<br/>
			Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.</p>
			<p>There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son<br/>
			Of God and Mary, in his victory,<br/>
			Both with the ancient council and the new,</p>
			<p>He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXIV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"O company elect to the great supper<br/>
			Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you<br/>
			So that for ever full is your desire,</p>
			<p>If by the grace of God this man foretaste<br/>
			Something of that which falleth from your table,<br/>
			Or ever death prescribe to him the time,</p>
			<p>Direct your mind to his immense desire,<br/>
			And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are<br/>
			For ever at the fount whence comes his thought."</p>
			<p>Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified<br/>
			Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,<br/>
			Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.</p>
			<p>And as the wheels in works of horologes<br/>
			Revolve so that the first to the beholder<br/>
			Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,</p>
			<p>So in like manner did those carols, dancing<br/>
			In different measure, of their affluence<br/>
			Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.</p>
			<p>From that one which I noted of most beauty<br/>
			Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy<br/>
			That none it left there of a greater brightness;</p>
			<p>And around Beatrice three several times<br/>
			It whirled itself with so divine a song,<br/>
			My fantasy repeats it not to me;</p>
			<p>Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,<br/>
			Since our imagination for such folds,<br/>
			Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.</p>
			<p>"O holy sister mine, who us implorest<br/>
			With such devotion, by thine ardent love<br/>
			Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!"</p>
			<p>Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire<br/>
			Unto my Lady did direct its breath,<br/>
			Which spake in fashion as I here have said.</p>
			<p>And she: "O light eterne of the great man<br/>
			To whom our Lord delivered up the keys<br/>
			He carried down of this miraculous joy,</p>
			<p>This one examine on points light and grave,<br/>
			As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith<br/>
			By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.</p>
			<p>If he love well, and hope well, and believe,<br/>
			From thee 'tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight<br/>
			There where depicted everything is seen.</p>
			<p>But since this kingdom has made citizens<br/>
			By means of the true Faith, to glorify it<br/>
			'Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof."</p>
			<p>As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not<br/>
			Until the master doth propose the question,<br/>
			To argue it, and not to terminate it,</p>
			<p>So did I arm myself with every reason,<br/>
			While she was speaking, that I might be ready<br/>
			For such a questioner and such profession.</p>
			<p>"Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;<br/>
			What is the Faith?"  Whereat I raised my brow<br/>
			Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.</p>
			<p>Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she<br/>
			Prompt signals made to me that I should pour<br/>
			The water forth from my internal fountain.</p>
			<p>"May grace, that suffers me to make confession,"<br/>
			Began I, "to the great centurion,<br/>
			Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!"</p>
			<p>And I continued: "As the truthful pen,<br/>
			Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<br/>
			Who put with thee Rome into the good way,</p>
			<p>Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,<br/>
			And evidence of those that are not seen;<br/>
			And this appears to me its quiddity."</p>
			<p>Then heard I: "Very rightly thou perceivest,<br/>
			If well thou understandest why he placed it<br/>
			With substances and then with evidences."</p>
			<p>And I thereafterward: "The things profound,<br/>
			That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,<br/>
			Unto all eyes below are so concealed,</p>
			<p>That they exist there only in belief,<br/>
			Upon the which is founded the high hope,<br/>
			And hence it takes the nature of a substance.</p>
			<p>And it behoveth us from this belief<br/>
			To reason without having other sight,<br/>
			And hence it has the nature of evidence."</p>
			<p>Then heard I: "If whatever is acquired<br/>
			Below by doctrine were thus understood,<br/>
			No sophist's subtlety would there find place."</p>
			<p>Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;<br/>
			Then added: "Very well has been gone over<br/>
			Already of this coin the alloy and weight;</p>
			<p>But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?"<br/>
			And I: "Yes, both so shining and so round<br/>
			That in its stamp there is no peradventure."</p>
			<p>Thereafter issued from the light profound<br/>
			That there resplendent was: "This precious jewel,<br/>
			Upon the which is every virtue founded,</p>
			<p>Whence hadst thou it?"  And I: "The large outpouring<br/>
			Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused<br/>
			Upon the ancient parchments and the new,</p>
			<p>A syllogism is, which proved it to me<br/>
			With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,<br/>
			All demonstration seems to me obtuse."</p>
			<p>And then I heard: "The ancient and the new<br/>
			Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,<br/>
			Why dost thou take them for the word divine?"</p>
			<p>And I: "The proofs, which show the truth to me,<br/>
			Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature<br/>
			Ne'er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat."</p>
			<p>'Twas answered me: "Say, who assureth thee<br/>
			That those works ever were? the thing itself<br/>
			That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it."</p>
			<p>"Were the world to Christianity converted,"<br/>
			I said, "withouten miracles, this one<br/>
			Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;</p>
			<p>Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter<br/>
			Into the field to sow there the good plant,<br/>
			Which was a vine and has become a thorn!"</p>
			<p>This being finished, the high, holy Court<br/>
			Resounded through the spheres, "One God we praise!"<br/>
			In melody that there above is chanted.</p>
			<p>And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<br/>
			Examining, had thus conducted me,<br/>
			Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,</p>
			<p>Again began: "The Grace that dallying<br/>
			Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,<br/>
			Up to this point, as it should opened be,</p>
			<p>So that I do approve what forth emerged;<br/>
			But now thou must express what thou believest,<br/>
			And whence to thy belief it was presented."</p>
			<p>"O holy father, spirit who beholdest<br/>
			What thou believedst so that thou o'ercamest,<br/>
			Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,"</p>
			<p>Began I, "thou dost wish me in this place<br/>
			The form to manifest of my prompt belief,<br/>
			And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.</p>
			<p>And I respond: In one God I believe,<br/>
			Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens<br/>
			With love and with desire, himself unmoved;</p>
			<p>And of such faith not only have I proofs<br/>
			Physical and metaphysical, but gives them<br/>
			Likewise the truth that from this place rains down</p>
			<p>Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,<br/>
			Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote<br/>
			After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;</p>
			<p>In Persons three eterne believe, and these<br/>
			One essence I believe, so one and trine<br/>
			They bear conjunction both with 'sunt' and 'est.'</p>
			<p>With the profound condition and divine<br/>
			Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind<br/>
			Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.</p>
			<p>This the beginning is, this is the spark<br/>
			Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,<br/>
			And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me."</p>
			<p>Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him<br/>
			His servant straight embraces, gratulating<br/>
			For the good news as soon as he is silent;</p>
			<p>So, giving me its benediction, singing,<br/>
			Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<br/>
			The apostolic light, at whose command</p>
			<p>I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXV</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">If e'er it happen that the Poem Sacred,<br/>
			To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,<br/>
			So that it many a year hath made me lean,</p>
			<p>O'ercome the cruelty that bars me out<br/>
			From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,<br/>
			An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,</p>
			<p>With other voice forthwith, with other fleece<br/>
			Poet will I return, and at my font<br/>
			Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;</p>
			<p>Because into the Faith that maketh known<br/>
			All souls to God there entered I, and then<br/>
			Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.</p>
			<p>Thereafterward towards us moved a light<br/>
			Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<br/>
			Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,</p>
			<p>And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,<br/>
			Said unto me: "Look, look! behold the Baron<br/>
			For whom below Galicia is frequented."</p>
			<p>In the same way as, when a dove alights<br/>
			Near his companion, both of them pour forth,<br/>
			Circling about and murmuring, their affection,</p>
			<p>So one beheld I by the other grand<br/>
			Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,<br/>
			Lauding the food that there above is eaten.</p>
			<p>But when their gratulations were complete,<br/>
			Silently 'coram me' each one stood still,<br/>
			So incandescent it o'ercame my sight.</p>
			<p>Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:<br/>
			"Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<br/>
			Of our Basilica have been described,</p>
			<p>Make Hope resound within this altitude;<br/>
			Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it<br/>
			As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness."—</p>
			<p>"Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<br/>
			For what comes hither from the mortal world<br/>
			Must needs be ripened in our radiance."</p>
			<p>This comfort came to me from the second fire;<br/>
			Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<br/>
			Which bent them down before with too great weight.</p>
			<p>"Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou<br/>
			Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,<br/>
			In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,</p>
			<p>So that, the truth beholden of this court,<br/>
			Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,<br/>
			Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,</p>
			<p>Say what it is, and how is flowering with it<br/>
			Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee."<br/>
			Thus did the second light again continue.</p>
			<p>And the Compassionate, who piloted<br/>
			The plumage of my wings in such high flight,<br/>
			Did in reply anticipate me thus:</p>
			<p>"No child whatever the Church Militant<br/>
			Of greater hope possesses, as is written<br/>
			In that Sun which irradiates all our band;</p>
			<p>Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt<br/>
			To come into Jerusalem to see,<br/>
			Or ever yet his warfare be completed.</p>
			<p>The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<br/>
			Have been demanded, but that he report<br/>
			How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,</p>
			<p>To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,<br/>
			Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<br/>
			And may the grace of God in this assist him!"</p>
			<p>As a disciple, who his teacher follows,<br/>
			Ready and willing, where he is expert,<br/>
			That his proficiency may be displayed,</p>
			<p>"Hope," said I, "is the certain expectation<br/>
			Of future glory, which is the effect<br/>
			Of grace divine and merit precedent.</p>
			<p>From many stars this light comes unto me;<br/>
			But he instilled it first into my heart<br/>
			Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.</p>
			<p>'Sperent in te,' in the high Theody<br/>
			He sayeth, 'those who know thy name;' and who<br/>
			Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?</p>
			<p>Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling<br/>
			In the Epistle, so that I am full,<br/>
			And upon others rain again your rain."</p>
			<p>While I was speaking, in the living bosom<br/>
			Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,<br/>
			Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;</p>
			<p>Then breathed: "The love wherewith I am inflamed<br/>
			Towards the virtue still which followed me<br/>
			Unto the palm and issue of the field,</p>
			<p>Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight<br/>
			In her; and grateful to me is thy telling<br/>
			Whatever things Hope promises to thee."</p>
			<p>And I: "The ancient Scriptures and the new<br/>
			The mark establish, and this shows it me,<br/>
			Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.</p>
			<p>Isaiah saith, that each one garmented<br/>
			In his own land shall be with twofold garments,<br/>
			And his own land is this delightful life.</p>
			<p>Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,<br/>
			There where he treateth of the robes of white,<br/>
			This revelation manifests to us."</p>
			<p>And first, and near the ending of these words,<br/>
			"Sperent in te" from over us was heard,<br/>
			To which responsive answered all the carols.</p>
			<p>Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<br/>
			So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<br/>
			Winter would have a month of one sole day.</p>
			<p>And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance<br/>
			A winsome maiden, only to do honour<br/>
			To the new bride, and not from any failing,</p>
			<p>Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour<br/>
			Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<br/>
			As was beseeming to their ardent love.</p>
			<p>Into the song and music there it entered;<br/>
			And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,<br/>
			Even as a bride silent and motionless.</p>
			<p>"This is the one who lay upon the breast<br/>
			Of him our Pelican; and this is he<br/>
			To the great office from the cross elected."</p>
			<p>My Lady thus; but therefore none the more<br/>
			Did move her sight from its attentive gaze<br/>
			Before or afterward these words of hers.</p>
			<p>Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours<br/>
			To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,<br/>
			And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,</p>
			<p>So I became before that latest fire,<br/>
			While it was said, "Why dost thou daze thyself<br/>
			To see a thing which here hath no existence?</p>
			<p>Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be<br/>
			With all the others there, until our number<br/>
			With the eternal proposition tallies.</p>
			<p>With the two garments in the blessed cloister<br/>
			Are the two lights alone that have ascended:<br/>
			And this shalt thou take back into your world."</p>
			<p>And at this utterance the flaming circle<br/>
			Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling<br/>
			Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,</p>
			<p>As to escape from danger or fatigue<br/>
			The oars that erst were in the water beaten<br/>
			Are all suspended at a whistle's sound.</p>
			<p>Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,<br/>
			When I turned round to look on Beatrice,<br/>
			That her I could not see, although I was</p>
			<p>Close at her side and in the Happy World!</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXVI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">While I was doubting for my vision quenched,<br/>
			Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it<br/>
			Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,</p>
			<p>Saying: "While thou recoverest the sense<br/>
			Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,<br/>
			'Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.</p>
			<p>Begin then, and declare to what thy soul<br/>
			Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,<br/>
			Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;</p>
			<p>Because the Lady, who through this divine<br/>
			Region conducteth thee, has in her look<br/>
			The power the hand of Ananias had."</p>
			<p>I said: "As pleaseth her, or soon or late<br/>
			Let the cure come to eyes that portals were<br/>
			When she with fire I ever burn with entered.</p>
			<p>The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,<br/>
			The Alpha and Omega is of all<br/>
			The writing that love reads me low or loud."</p>
			<p>The selfsame voice, that taken had from me<br/>
			The terror of the sudden dazzlement,<br/>
			To speak still farther put it in my thought;</p>
			<p>And said: "In verity with finer sieve<br/>
			Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth<br/>
			To say who aimed thy bow at such a target."</p>
			<p>And I: "By philosophic arguments,<br/>
			And by authority that hence descends,<br/>
			Such love must needs imprint itself in me;</p>
			<p>For Good, so far as good, when comprehended<br/>
			Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater<br/>
			As more of goodness in itself it holds;</p>
			<p>Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage<br/>
			That every good which out of it is found<br/>
			Is nothing but a ray of its own light)</p>
			<p>More than elsewhither must the mind be moved<br/>
			Of every one, in loving, who discerns<br/>
			The truth in which this evidence is founded.</p>
			<p>Such truth he to my intellect reveals<br/>
			Who demonstrates to me the primal love<br/>
			Of all the sempiternal substances.</p>
			<p>The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,<br/>
			Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,<br/>
			'I will make all my goodness pass before thee.'</p>
			<p>Thou too revealest it to me, beginning<br/>
			The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret<br/>
			Of heaven to earth above all other edict."</p>
			<p>And I heard say: "By human intellect<br/>
			And by authority concordant with it,<br/>
			Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.</p>
			<p>But say again if other cords thou feelest,<br/>
			Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim<br/>
			With how many teeth this love is biting thee."</p>
			<p>The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ<br/>
			Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived<br/>
			Whither he fain would my profession lead.</p>
			<p>Therefore I recommenced: "All of those bites<br/>
			Which have the power to turn the heart to God<br/>
			Unto my charity have been concurrent.</p>
			<p>The being of the world, and my own being,<br/>
			The death which He endured that I may live,<br/>
			And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,</p>
			<p>With the forementioned vivid consciousness<br/>
			Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,<br/>
			And of the right have placed me on the shore.</p>
			<p>The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden<br/>
			Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love<br/>
			As much as he has granted them of good."</p>
			<p>As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet<br/>
			Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady<br/>
			Said with the others, "Holy, holy, holy!"</p>
			<p>And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep<br/>
			By reason of the visual spirit that runs<br/>
			Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,</p>
			<p>And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,<br/>
			So all unconscious is his sudden waking,<br/>
			Until the judgment cometh to his aid,</p>
			<p>So from before mine eyes did Beatrice<br/>
			Chase every mote with radiance of her own,<br/>
			That cast its light a thousand miles and more.</p>
			<p>Whence better after than before I saw,<br/>
			And in a kind of wonderment I asked<br/>
			About a fourth light that I saw with us.</p>
			<p>And said my Lady: "There within those rays<br/>
			Gazes upon its Maker the first soul<br/>
			That ever the first virtue did create."</p>
			<p>Even as the bough that downward bends its top<br/>
			At transit of the wind, and then is lifted<br/>
			By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,</p>
			<p>Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,<br/>
			Being amazed, and then I was made bold<br/>
			By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.</p>
			<p>And I began: "O apple, that mature<br/>
			Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,<br/>
			To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,</p>
			<p>Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee<br/>
			That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;<br/>
			And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not."</p>
			<p>Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles<br/>
			So that his impulse needs must be apparent,<br/>
			By reason of the wrappage following it;</p>
			<p>And in like manner the primeval soul<br/>
			Made clear to me athwart its covering<br/>
			How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.</p>
			<p>Then breathed: "Without thy uttering it to me,<br/>
			Thine inclination better I discern<br/>
			Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;</p>
			<p>For I behold it in the truthful mirror,<br/>
			That of Himself all things parhelion makes,<br/>
			And none makes Him parhelion of itself.</p>
			<p>Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me<br/>
			Within the lofty garden, where this Lady<br/>
			Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.</p>
			<p>And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,<br/>
			And of the great disdain the proper cause,<br/>
			And the language that I used and that I made.</p>
			<p>Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree<br/>
			Not in itself was cause of so great exile,<br/>
			But solely the o'erstepping of the bounds.</p>
			<p>There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,<br/>
			Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits<br/>
			Made by the sun, this Council I desired;</p>
			<p>And him I saw return to all the lights<br/>
			Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,<br/>
			Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.</p>
			<p>The language that I spake was quite extinct<br/>
			Before that in the work interminable<br/>
			The people under Nimrod were employed;</p>
			<p>For nevermore result of reasoning<br/>
			(Because of human pleasure that doth change,<br/>
			Obedient to the heavens) was durable.</p>
			<p>A natural action is it that man speaks;<br/>
			But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave<br/>
			To your own art, as seemeth best to you.</p>
			<p>Ere I descended to the infernal anguish,<br/>
			'El' was on earth the name of the Chief Good,<br/>
			From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round</p>
			<p>'Eli' he then was called, and that is proper,<br/>
			Because the use of men is like a leaf<br/>
			On bough, which goeth and another cometh.</p>
			<p>Upon the mount that highest o'er the wave<br/>
			Rises was I, in life or pure or sinful,<br/>
			From the first hour to that which is the second,</p>
			<p>As the sun changes quadrant, to the sixth."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXVII</p>

			<p>O joy!  O gladness inexpressible!<br/>

			<p>With the same colour which, through sun adverse,<br/>

			Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused.</p>
			<p>And as a modest woman, who abides<br/>
			Sure of herself, and at another's failing,<br/>
			From listening only, timorous becomes,</p>
			<p>Even thus did Beatrice change countenance;<br/>
			And I believe in heaven was such eclipse,<br/>
			When suffered the supreme Omnipotence;</p>
			<p>Thereafterward proceeded forth his words<br/>
			With voice so much transmuted from itself,<br/>
			The very countenance was not more changed.</p>
			<p>"The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been<br/>

			<p>Our purpose was not, that on the right hand<br/>
			Of our successors should in part be seated<br/>
			The Christian folk, in part upon the other;</p>
			<p>Nor that the keys which were to me confided<br/>
			Should e'er become the escutcheon on a banner,<br/>
			That should wage war on those who are baptized;</p>
			<p>Nor I be made the figure of a seal<br/>
			To privileges venal and mendacious,<br/>
			Whereat I often redden and flash with fire.</p>
			<p>In garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves<br/>
			Are seen from here above o'er all the pastures!<br/>
			O wrath of God, why dost thou slumber still?</p>
			<p>To drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons<br/>

			<p>But the high Providence, that with Scipio<br/>
			At Rome the glory of the world defended,<br/>
			Will speedily bring aid, as I conceive;</p>
			<p>And thou, my son, who by thy mortal weight<br/>

			<p>As with its frozen vapours downward falls<br/>
			In flakes our atmosphere, what time the horn<br/>
			Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun,</p>
			<p>Upward in such array saw I the ether<br/>
			Become, and flaked with the triumphant vapours,<br/>
			Which there together with us had remained.</p>
			<p>My sight was following up their semblances,<br/>
			And followed till the medium, by excess,<br/>
			The passing farther onward took from it;</p>
			<p>Whereat the Lady, who beheld me freed<br/>
			From gazing upward, said to me: "Cast down<br/>
			Thy sight, and see how far thou art turned round."</p>
			<p>Since the first time that I had downward looked,<br/>
			I saw that I had moved through the whole arc<br/>
			Which the first climate makes from midst to end;</p>
			<p>So that I saw the mad track of Ulysses<br/>
			Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore<br/>
			Whereon became Europa a sweet burden.</p>
			<p>And of this threshing-floor the site to me<br/>
			Were more unveiled, but the sun was proceeding<br/>
			Under my feet, a sign and more removed.</p>
			<p>My mind enamoured, which is dallying<br/>
			At all times with my Lady, to bring back<br/>
			To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent.</p>
			<p>And if or Art or Nature has made bait<br/>
			To catch the eyes and so possess the mind,<br/>
			In human flesh or in its portraiture,</p>
			<p>All joined together would appear as nought<br/>
			To the divine delight which shone upon me<br/>
			When to her smiling face I turned me round.</p>
			<p>The virtue that her look endowed me with<br/>
			From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth,<br/>
			And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me.</p>
			<p>Its parts exceeding full of life and lofty<br/>
			Are all so uniform, I cannot say<br/>
			Which Beatrice selected for my place.</p>
			<p>But she, who was aware of my desire,<br/>
			Began, the while she smiled so joyously<br/>
			That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice:</p>
			<p>"The nature of that motion, which keeps quiet<br/>
			The centre and all the rest about it moves,<br/>
			From hence begins as from its starting point.</p>
			<p>And in this heaven there is no other Where<br/>
			Than in the Mind Divine, wherein is kindled<br/>
			The love that turns it, and the power it rains.</p>
			<p>Within a circle light and love embrace it,<br/>
			Even as this doth the others, and that precinct<br/>
			He who encircles it alone controls.</p>
			<p>Its motion is not by another meted,<br/>
			But all the others measured are by this,<br/>
			As ten is by the half and by the fifth.</p>
			<p>And in what manner time in such a pot<br/>
			May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves,<br/>
			Now unto thee can manifest be made.</p>
			<p>O Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf<br/>
			Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power<br/>
			Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves!</p>
			<p>Full fairly blossoms in mankind the will;<br/>
			But the uninterrupted rain converts<br/>
			Into abortive wildings the true plums.</p>
			<p>Fidelity and innocence are found<br/>
			Only in children; afterwards they both<br/>
			Take flight or e'er the cheeks with down are covered.</p>
			<p>One, while he prattles still, observes the fasts,<br/>
			Who, when his tongue is loosed, forthwith devours<br/>
			Whatever food under whatever moon;</p>
			<p>Another, while he prattles, loves and listens<br/>
			Unto his mother, who when speech is perfect<br/>
			Forthwith desires to see her in her grave.</p>
			<p>Even thus is swarthy made the skin so white<br/>
			In its first aspect of the daughter fair<br/>
			Of him who brings the morn, and leaves the night.</p>
			<p>Thou, that it may not be a marvel to thee,<br/>
			Think that on earth there is no one who governs;<br/>
			Whence goes astray the human family.</p>
			<p>Ere January be unwintered wholly<br/>
			By the centesimal on earth neglected,<br/>
			Shall these supernal circles roar so loud</p>
			<p>The tempest that has been so long awaited<br/>
			Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows;<br/>
			So that the fleet shall run its course direct,</p>
			<p>And the true fruit shall follow on the flower."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXVIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">After the truth against the present life<br/>

			By her who doth imparadise my mind,</p>
			<p>As in a looking-glass a taper's flame<br/>

			Before he has it in his sight or thought,</p>
			<p>And turns him round to see if so the glass<br/>

			Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me.</p>
			<p>And as I turned me round, and mine were touched<br/>
			By that which is apparent in that volume,<br/>
			Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,</p>
			<p>A point beheld I, that was raying out<br/>
			Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles<br/>
			Must close perforce before such great acuteness.</p>
			<p>And whatsoever star seems smallest here<br/>
			Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.<br/>
			As one star with another star is placed.</p>
			<p>Perhaps at such a distance as appears<br/>
			A halo cincturing the light that paints it,<br/>
			When densest is the vapour that sustains it,</p>
			<p>Thus distant round the point a circle of fire<br/>
			So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed<br/>
			Whatever motion soonest girds the world;</p>
			<p>And this was by another circumcinct,<br/>
			That by a third, the third then by a fourth,<br/>
			By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;</p>
			<p>The seventh followed thereupon in width<br/>
			So ample now, that Juno's messenger<br/>
			Entire would be too narrow to contain it.</p>
			<p>Even so the eighth and ninth; and every one<br/>
			More slowly moved, according as it was<br/>
			In number distant farther from the first.</p>
			<p>And that one had its flame most crystalline<br/>
			From which less distant was the stainless spark,<br/>
			I think because more with its truth imbued.</p>
			<p>My Lady, who in my anxiety<br/>
			Beheld me much perplexed, said: "From that point<br/>
			Dependent is the heaven and nature all.</p>
			<p>Behold that circle most conjoined to it,<br/>
			And know thou, that its motion is so swift<br/>
			Through burning love whereby it is spurred on."</p>
			<p>And I to her: "If the world were arranged<br/>
			In the order which I see in yonder wheels,<br/>
			What's set before me would have satisfied me;</p>
			<p>But in the world of sense we can perceive<br/>
			That evermore the circles are diviner<br/>
			As they are from the centre more remote</p>
			<p>Wherefore if my desire is to be ended<br/>
			In this miraculous and angelic temple,<br/>
			That has for confines only love and light,</p>
			<p>To hear behoves me still how the example<br/>
			And the exemplar go not in one fashion,<br/>
			Since for myself in vain I contemplate it."</p>
			<p>"If thine own fingers unto such a knot<br/>
			Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,<br/>
			So hard hath it become for want of trying."</p>
			<p>My Lady thus; then said she: "Do thou take<br/>
			What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,<br/>
			And exercise on that thy subtlety.</p>
			<p>The circles corporal are wide and narrow<br/>
			According to the more or less of virtue<br/>
			Which is distributed through all their parts.</p>
			<p>The greater goodness works the greater weal,<br/>
			The greater weal the greater body holds,<br/>
			If perfect equally are all its parts.</p>
			<p>Therefore this one which sweeps along with it<br/>
			The universe sublime, doth correspond<br/>
			Unto the circle which most loves and knows.</p>
			<p>On which account, if thou unto the virtue<br/>
			Apply thy measure, not to the appearance<br/>
			Of substances that unto thee seem round,</p>
			<p>Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,<br/>
			Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,<br/>
			In every heaven, with its Intelligence."</p>
			<p>Even as remaineth splendid and serene<br/>
			The hemisphere of air, when Boreas<br/>
			Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,</p>
			<p>Because is purified and resolved the rack<br/>
			That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs<br/>
			With all the beauties of its pageantry;</p>
			<p>Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady<br/>
			Had me provided with her clear response,<br/>
			And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.</p>
			<p>And soon as to a stop her words had come,<br/>
			Not otherwise does iron scintillate<br/>
			When molten, than those circles scintillated.</p>
			<p>Their coruscation all the sparks repeated,<br/>
			And they so many were, their number makes<br/>
			More millions than the doubling of the chess.</p>
			<p>I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir<br/>
			To the fixed point which holds them at the 'Ubi,'<br/>
			And ever will, where they have ever been.</p>
			<p>And she, who saw the dubious meditations<br/>
			Within my mind, "The primal circles," said,<br/>
			"Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.</p>
			<p>Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds,<br/>
			To be as like the point as most they can,<br/>
			And can as far as they are high in vision.</p>
			<p>Those other Loves, that round about them go,<br/>
			Thrones of the countenance divine are called,<br/>
			Because they terminate the primal Triad.</p>
			<p>And thou shouldst know that they all have delight<br/>
			As much as their own vision penetrates<br/>
			The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.</p>
			<p>From this it may be seen how blessedness<br/>
			Is founded in the faculty which sees,<br/>
			And not in that which loves, and follows next;</p>
			<p>And of this seeing merit is the measure,<br/>
			Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;<br/>
			Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.</p>
			<p>The second Triad, which is germinating<br/>
			In such wise in this sempiternal spring,<br/>
			That no nocturnal Aries despoils,</p>
			<p>Perpetually hosanna warbles forth<br/>
			With threefold melody, that sounds in three<br/>
			Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.</p>
			<p>The three Divine are in this hierarchy,<br/>
			First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;<br/>
			And the third order is that of the Powers.</p>
			<p>Then in the dances twain penultimate<br/>
			The Principalities and Archangels wheel;<br/>
			The last is wholly of angelic sports.</p>
			<p>These orders upward all of them are gazing,<br/>
			And downward so prevail, that unto God<br/>
			They all attracted are and all attract.</p>
			<p>And Dionysius with so great desire<br/>
			To contemplate these Orders set himself,<br/>
			He named them and distinguished them as I do.</p>
			<p>But Gregory afterwards dissented from him;<br/>
			Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes<br/>
			Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.</p>
			<p>And if so much of secret truth a mortal<br/>
			Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,<br/>
			For he who saw it here revealed it to him,</p>
			<p>With much more of the truth about these circles."</p>

			So swiftly, as a portion of these angels<br/>
			Disturbed the subject of your elements.</p>
			<p>The rest remained, and they began this art<br/>
			Which thou discernest, with so great delight<br/>
			That never from their circling do they cease.</p>
			<p>The occasion of the fall was the accursed<br/>
			Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen<br/>
			By all the burden of the world constrained.</p>
			<p>Those whom thou here beholdest modest were<br/>
			To recognise themselves as of that goodness<br/>
			Which made them apt for so much understanding;</p>
			<p>On which account their vision was exalted<br/>
			By the enlightening grace and their own merit,<br/>
			So that they have a full and steadfast will.</p>
			<p>I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,<br/>
			'Tis meritorious to receive this grace,<br/>
			According as the affection opens to it.</p>
			<p>Now round about in this consistory<br/>
			Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words<br/>
			Be gathered up, without all further aid.</p>
			<p>But since upon the earth, throughout your schools,<br/>
			They teach that such is the angelic nature<br/>
			That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,</p>
			<p>More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed<br/>
			The truth that is confounded there below,<br/>
			Equivocating in such like prelections.</p>
			<p>These substances, since in God's countenance<br/>
			They jocund were, turned not away their sight<br/>
			From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;</p>
			<p>Hence they have not their vision intercepted<br/>
			By object new, and hence they do not need<br/>
			To recollect, through interrupted thought.</p>
			<p>So that below, not sleeping, people dream,<br/>
			Believing they speak truth, and not believing;<br/>
			And in the last is greater sin and shame.</p>
			<p>Below you do not journey by one path<br/>
			Philosophising; so transporteth you<br/>
			Love of appearance and the thought thereof.</p>
			<p>And even this above here is endured<br/>
			With less disdain, than when is set aside<br/>
			The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.</p>
			<p>They think not there how much of blood it costs<br/>
			To sow it in the world, and how he pleases<br/>
			Who in humility keeps close to it.</p>
			<p>Each striveth for appearance, and doth make<br/>
			His own inventions; and these treated are<br/>
			By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.</p>
			<p>One sayeth that the moon did backward turn,<br/>
			In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself<br/>
			So that the sunlight reached not down below;</p>
			<p>And lies; for of its own accord the light<br/>
			Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,<br/>
			As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.</p>
			<p>Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi<br/>
			As fables such as these, that every year<br/>
			Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,</p>
			<p>In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,<br/>
			Come back from pasture fed upon the wind,<br/>
			And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.</p>
			<p>Christ did not to his first disciples say,<br/>
			'Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,'<br/>
			But unto them a true foundation gave;</p>
			<p>And this so loudly sounded from their lips,<br/>
			That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,<br/>
			They made of the Evangel shields and lances.</p>
			<p>Now men go forth with jests and drolleries<br/>
			To preach, and if but well the people laugh,<br/>
			The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.</p>
			<p>But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,<br/>
			That, if the common people were to see it,<br/>
			They would perceive what pardons they confide in,</p>
			<p>For which so great on earth has grown the folly,<br/>
			That, without proof of any testimony,<br/>
			To each indulgence they would flock together.</p>
			<p>By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,<br/>
			And many others, who are worse than pigs,<br/>
			Paying in money without mark of coinage.</p>
			<p>But since we have digressed abundantly,<br/>
			Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,<br/>
			So that the way be shortened with the time.</p>
			<p>This nature doth so multiply itself<br/>
			In numbers, that there never yet was speech<br/>
			Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.</p>
			<p>And if thou notest that which is revealed<br/>
			By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands<br/>
			Number determinate is kept concealed.</p>
			<p>The primal light, that all irradiates it,<br/>
			By modes as many is received therein,<br/>
			As are the splendours wherewith it is mated.</p>
			<p>Hence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive<br/>
			The affection followeth, of love the sweetness<br/>
			Therein diversely fervid is or tepid.</p>
			<p>The height behold now and the amplitude<br/>
			Of the eternal power, since it hath made<br/>
			Itself so many mirrors, where 'tis broken,</p>
			<p>One in itself remaining as before."</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXX</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Perchance six thousand miles remote from us<br/>
			Is glowing the sixth hour, and now this world<br/>
			Inclines its shadow almost to a level,</p>
			<p>When the mid-heaven begins to make itself<br/>
			So deep to us, that here and there a star<br/>
			Ceases to shine so far down as this depth,</p>
			<p>And as advances bright exceedingly<br/>
			The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed<br/>
			Light after light to the most beautiful;</p>
			<p>Not otherwise the Triumph, which for ever<br/>
			Plays round about the point that vanquished me,<br/>
			Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,</p>
			<p>Little by little from my vision faded;<br/>
			Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice<br/>
			My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.</p>
			<p>If what has hitherto been said of her<br/>
			Were all concluded in a single praise,<br/>
			Scant would it be to serve the present turn.</p>
			<p>Not only does the beauty I beheld<br/>
			Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe<br/>
			Its Maker only may enjoy it all.</p>
			<p>Vanquished do I confess me by this passage<br/>
			More than by problem of his theme was ever<br/>
			O'ercome the comic or the tragic poet;</p>
			<p>For as the sun the sight that trembles most,<br/>
			Even so the memory of that sweet smile<br/>
			My mind depriveth of its very self.</p>
			<p>From the first day that I beheld her face<br/>
			In this life, to the moment of this look,<br/>
			The sequence of my song has ne'er been severed;</p>
			<p>But now perforce this sequence must desist<br/>
			From following her beauty with my verse,<br/>
			As every artist at his uttermost.</p>
			<p>Such as I leave her to a greater fame<br/>
			Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing<br/>
			Its arduous matter to a final close,</p>
			<p>With voice and gesture of a perfect leader<br/>
			She recommenced: "We from the greatest body<br/>
			Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;</p>
			<p>Light intellectual replete with love,<br/>
			Love of true good replete with ecstasy,<br/>
			Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness.</p>
			<p>Here shalt thou see the one host and the other<br/>
			Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects<br/>
			Which at the final judgment thou shalt see."</p>
			<p>Even as a sudden lightning that disperses<br/>
			The visual spirits, so that it deprives<br/>
			The eye of impress from the strongest objects,</p>
			<p>Thus round about me flashed a living light,<br/>
			And left me swathed around with such a veil<br/>
			Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.</p>
			<p>"Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven<br/>
			Welcomes into itself with such salute,<br/>
			To make the candle ready for its flame."</p>
			<p>No sooner had within me these brief words<br/>
			An entrance found, than I perceived myself<br/>
			To be uplifted over my own power,</p>
			<p>And I with vision new rekindled me,<br/>
			Such that no light whatever is so pure<br/>
			But that mine eyes were fortified against it.</p>
			<p>And light I saw in fashion of a river<br/>
			Fulvid with its effulgence, 'twixt two banks<br/>
			Depicted with an admirable Spring.</p>
			<p>Out of this river issued living sparks,<br/>
			And on all sides sank down into the flowers,<br/>
			Like unto rubies that are set in gold;</p>
			<p>And then, as if inebriate with the odours,<br/>
			They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,<br/>
			And as one entered issued forth another.</p>
			<p>"The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee<br/>
			To have intelligence of what thou seest,<br/>
			Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.</p>
			<p>But of this water it behoves thee drink<br/>
			Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked."<br/>
			Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;</p>
			<p>And added: "The river and the topazes<br/>
			Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,<br/>
			Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;</p>
			<p>Not that these things are difficult in themselves,<br/>
			But the deficiency is on thy side,<br/>
			For yet thou hast not vision so exalted."</p>
			<p>There is no babe that leaps so suddenly<br/>
			With face towards the milk, if he awake<br/>
			Much later than his usual custom is,</p>
			<p>As I did, that I might make better mirrors<br/>
			Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave<br/>
			Which flows that we therein be better made.</p>
			<p>And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids<br/>
			Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me<br/>
			Out of its length to be transformed to round.</p>
			<p>Then as a folk who have been under masks<br/>
			Seem other than before, if they divest<br/>
			The semblance not their own they disappeared in,</p>
			<p>Thus into greater pomp were changed for me<br/>
			The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw<br/>
			Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.</p>
			<p>O splendour of God! by means of which I saw<br/>
			The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,<br/>
			Give me the power to say how it I saw!</p>
			<p>There is a light above, which visible<br/>
			Makes the Creator unto every creature,<br/>
			Who only in beholding Him has peace,</p>
			<p>And it expands itself in circular form<br/>
			To such extent, that its circumference<br/>
			Would be too large a girdle for the sun.</p>
			<p>The semblance of it is all made of rays<br/>
			Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,<br/>
			Which takes therefrom vitality and power.</p>
			<p>And as a hill in water at its base<br/>
			Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty<br/>
			When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,</p>
			<p>So, ranged aloft all round about the light,<br/>
			Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand<br/>
			All who above there have from us returned.</p>
			<p>And if the lowest row collect within it<br/>
			So great a light, how vast the amplitude<br/>
			Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!</p>
			<p>My vision in the vastness and the height<br/>
			Lost not itself, but comprehended all<br/>
			The quantity and quality of that gladness.</p>
			<p>There near and far nor add nor take away;<br/>
			For there where God immediately doth govern,<br/>
			The natural law in naught is relevant.</p>
			<p>Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal<br/>
			That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour<br/>
			Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,</p>
			<p>As one who silent is and fain would speak,<br/>
			Me Beatrice drew on, and said: "Behold<br/>
			Of the white stoles how vast the convent is!</p>
			<p>Behold how vast the circuit of our city!<br/>
			Behold our seats so filled to overflowing,<br/>
			That here henceforward are few people wanting!</p>
			<p>On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed<br/>
			For the crown's sake already placed upon it,<br/>
			Before thou suppest at this wedding feast</p>
			<p>Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus<br/>
			On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come<br/>
			To redress Italy ere she be ready.</p>
			<p>Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you,<br/>
			Has made you like unto the little child,<br/>
			Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse.</p>
			<p>And in the sacred forum then shall be<br/>
			A Prefect such, that openly or covert<br/>
			On the same road he will not walk with him.</p>
			<p>But long of God he will not be endured<br/>
			In holy office; he shall be thrust down<br/>
			Where Simon Magus is for his deserts,</p>
			<p>And make him of Alagna lower go!"</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXXI</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">In fashion then as of a snow-white rose<br/>
			Displayed itself to me the saintly host,<br/>
			Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride,</p>
			<p>But the other host, that flying sees and sings<br/>
			The glory of Him who doth enamour it,<br/>
			And the goodness that created it so noble,</p>
			<p>Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers<br/>
			One moment, and the next returns again<br/>
			To where its labour is to sweetness turned,</p>
			<p>Sank into the great flower, that is adorned<br/>
			With leaves so many, and thence reascended<br/>
			To where its love abideth evermore.</p>
			<p>Their faces had they all of living flame,<br/>
			And wings of gold, and all the rest so white<br/>
			No snow unto that limit doth attain.</p>
			<p>From bench to bench, into the flower descending,<br/>
			They carried something of the peace and ardour<br/>
			Which by the fanning of their flanks they won.</p>
			<p>Nor did the interposing 'twixt the flower<br/>
			And what was o'er it of such plenitude<br/>
			Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour;</p>
			<p>Because the light divine so penetrates<br/>
			The universe, according to its merit,<br/>
			That naught can be an obstacle against it.</p>
			<p>This realm secure and full of gladsomeness,<br/>
			Crowded with ancient people and with modern,<br/>
			Unto one mark had all its look and love.</p>
			<p>O Trinal Light, that in a single star<br/>
			Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them,<br/>
			Look down upon our tempest here below!</p>
			<p>If the barbarians, coming from some region<br/>
			That every day by Helice is covered,<br/>
			Revolving with her son whom she delights in,</p>
			<p>Beholding Rome and all her noble works,<br/>
			Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran<br/>
			Above all mortal things was eminent,—</p>
			<p>I who to the divine had from the human,<br/>
			From time unto eternity, had come,<br/>
			From Florence to a people just and sane,</p>
			<p>With what amazement must I have been filled!<br/>
			Truly between this and the joy, it was<br/>
			My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.</p>
			<p>And as a pilgrim who delighteth him<br/>
			In gazing round the temple of his vow,<br/>
			And hopes some day to retell how it was,</p>
			<p>So through the living light my way pursuing<br/>
			Directed I mine eyes o'er all the ranks,<br/>
			Now up, now down, and now all round about.</p>
			<p>Faces I saw of charity persuasive,<br/>
			Embellished by His light and their own smile,<br/>
			And attitudes adorned with every grace.</p>
			<p>The general form of Paradise already<br/>
			My glance had comprehended as a whole,<br/>
			In no part hitherto remaining fixed,</p>
			<p>And round I turned me with rekindled wish<br/>
			My Lady to interrogate of things<br/>
			Concerning which my mind was in suspense.</p>
			<p>One thing I meant, another answered me;<br/>
			I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw<br/>
			An Old Man habited like the glorious people.</p>
			<p>O'erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks<br/>
			With joy benign, in attitude of pity<br/>
			As to a tender father is becoming.</p>
			<p>And "She, where is she?" instantly I said;<br/>
			Whence he: "To put an end to thy desire,<br/>
			Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.</p>
			<p>And if thou lookest up to the third round<br/>
			Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her<br/>
			Upon the throne her merits have assigned her."</p>
			<p>Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,<br/>
			And saw her, as she made herself a crown<br/>
			Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.</p>
			<p>Not from that region which the highest thunders<br/>
			Is any mortal eye so far removed,<br/>
			In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,</p>
			<p>As there from Beatrice my sight; but this<br/>
			Was nothing unto me; because her image<br/>
			Descended not to me by medium blurred.</p>
			<p>"O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,<br/>
			And who for my salvation didst endure<br/>
			In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,</p>
			<p>Of whatsoever things I have beheld,<br/>
			As coming from thy power and from thy goodness<br/>
			I recognise the virtue and the grace.</p>
			<p>Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,<br/>
			By all those ways, by all the expedients,<br/>
			Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.</p>
			<p>Preserve towards me thy magnificence,<br/>
			So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,<br/>
			Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body."</p>
			<p>Thus I implored; and she, so far away,<br/>
			Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;<br/>
			Then unto the eternal fountain turned.</p>
			<p>And said the Old Man holy: "That thou mayst<br/>
			Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,<br/>
			Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,</p>
			<p>Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;<br/>
			For seeing it will discipline thy sight<br/>
			Farther to mount along the ray divine.</p>
			<p>And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn<br/>
			Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,<br/>
			Because that I her faithful Bernard am."</p>
			<p>As he who peradventure from Croatia<br/>
			Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,<br/>
			Who through its ancient fame is never sated,</p>
			<p>But says in thought, the while it is displayed,<br/>
			"My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,<br/>
			Now was your semblance made like unto this?"</p>
			<p>Even such was I while gazing at the living<br/>
			Charity of the man, who in this world<br/>
			By contemplation tasted of that peace.</p>
			<p>"Thou son of grace, this jocund life," began he,<br/>
			"Will not be known to thee by keeping ever<br/>
			Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;</p>
			<p>But mark the circles to the most remote,<br/>
			Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen<br/>
			To whom this realm is subject and devoted."</p>
			<p>I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn<br/>
			The oriental part of the horizon<br/>
			Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,</p>
			<p>Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale<br/>
			To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness<br/>
			Surpass in splendour all the other front.</p>
			<p>And even as there where we await the pole<br/>
			That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more<br/>
			The light, and is on either side diminished,</p>
			<p>So likewise that pacific oriflamme<br/>
			Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side<br/>
			In equal measure did the flame abate.</p>
			<p>And at that centre, with their wings expanded,<br/>
			More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,<br/>
			Each differing in effulgence and in kind.</p>
			<p>I saw there at their sports and at their songs<br/>
			A beauty smiling, which the gladness was<br/>
			Within the eyes of all the other saints;</p>
			<p>And if I had in speaking as much wealth<br/>
			As in imagining, I should not dare<br/>
			To attempt the smallest part of its delight.</p>
			<p>Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes<br/>
			Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,<br/>
			His own with such affection turned to her</p>
			<p>That it made mine more ardent to behold.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXXII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator<br/>
			Assumed the willing office of a teacher,<br/>
			And gave beginning to these holy words:</p>
			<p>"The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,<br/>
			She at her feet who is so beautiful,<br/>
			She is the one who opened it and pierced it.</p>
			<p>Within that order which the third seats make<br/>
			Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,<br/>
			With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.</p>
			<p>Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was<br/>
			Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole<br/>
			Of the misdeed said, 'Miserere mei,'</p>
			<p>Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending<br/>
			Down in gradation, as with each one's name<br/>
			I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.</p>
			<p>And downward from the seventh row, even as<br/>
			Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,<br/>
			Dividing all the tresses of the flower;</p>
			<p>Because, according to the view which Faith<br/>
			In Christ had taken, these are the partition<br/>
			By which the sacred stairways are divided.</p>
			<p>Upon this side, where perfect is the flower<br/>
			With each one of its petals, seated are<br/>
			Those who believed in Christ who was to come.</p>
			<p>Upon the other side, where intersected<br/>
			With vacant spaces are the semicircles,<br/>
			Are those who looked to Christ already come.</p>
			<p>And as, upon this side, the glorious seat<br/>
			Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats<br/>
			Below it, such a great division make,</p>
			<p>So opposite doth that of the great John,<br/>
			Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom<br/>
			Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.</p>
			<p>And under him thus to divide were chosen<br/>
			Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,<br/>
			And down to us the rest from round to round.</p>
			<p>Behold now the high providence divine;<br/>
			For one and other aspect of the Faith<br/>
			In equal measure shall this garden fill.</p>
			<p>And know that downward from that rank which cleaves<br/>
			Midway the sequence of the two divisions,<br/>
			Not by their proper merit are they seated;</p>
			<p>But by another's under fixed conditions;<br/>
			For these are spirits one and all assoiled<br/>
			Before they any true election had.</p>
			<p>Well canst thou recognise it in their faces,<br/>
			And also in their voices puerile,<br/>
			If thou regard them well and hearken to them.</p>
			<p>Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;<br/>
			But I will loosen for thee the strong bond<br/>
			In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.</p>
			<p>Within the amplitude of this domain<br/>
			No casual point can possibly find place,<br/>
			No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;</p>
			<p>For by eternal law has been established<br/>
			Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely<br/>
			The ring is fitted to the finger here.</p>
			<p>And therefore are these people, festinate<br/>
			Unto true life, not 'sine causa' here<br/>
			More and less excellent among themselves.</p>
			<p>The King, by means of whom this realm reposes<br/>
			In so great love and in so great delight<br/>
			That no will ventureth to ask for more,</p>
			<p>In his own joyous aspect every mind<br/>
			Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace<br/>
			Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.</p>
			<p>And this is clearly and expressly noted<br/>
			For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins<br/>
			Who in their mother had their anger roused.</p>
			<p>According to the colour of the hair,<br/>
			Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme<br/>
			Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.</p>
			<p>Without, then, any merit of their deeds,<br/>
			Stationed are they in different gradations,<br/>
			Differing only in their first acuteness.</p>
			<p>'Tis true that in the early centuries,<br/>
			With innocence, to work out their salvation<br/>
			Sufficient was the faith of parents only.</p>
			<p>After the earlier ages were completed,<br/>
			Behoved it that the males by circumcision<br/>
			Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;</p>
			<p>But after that the time of grace had come<br/>
			Without the baptism absolute of Christ,<br/>
			Such innocence below there was retained.</p>
			<p>Look now into the face that unto Christ<br/>
			Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only<br/>
			Is able to prepare thee to see Christ."</p>
			<p>On her did I behold so great a gladness<br/>
			Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds<br/>
			Created through that altitude to fly,</p>
			<p>That whatsoever I had seen before<br/>
			Did not suspend me in such admiration,<br/>
			Nor show me such similitude of God.</p>
			<p>And the same Love that first descended there,<br/>
			"Ave Maria, gratia plena," singing,<br/>
			In front of her his wings expanded wide.</p>
			<p>Unto the canticle divine responded<br/>
			From every part the court beatified,<br/>
			So that each sight became serener for it.</p>
			<p>"O holy father, who for me endurest<br/>
			To be below here, leaving the sweet place<br/>
			In which thou sittest by eternal lot,</p>
			<p>Who is the Angel that with so much joy<br/>
			Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,<br/>
			Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?"</p>
			<p>Thus I again recourse had to the teaching<br/>
			Of that one who delighted him in Mary<br/>
			As doth the star of morning in the sun.</p>
			<p>And he to me: "Such gallantry and grace<br/>
			As there can be in Angel and in soul,<br/>
			All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;</p>
			<p>Because he is the one who bore the palm<br/>
			Down unto Mary, when the Son of God<br/>
			To take our burden on himself decreed.</p>
			<p>But now come onward with thine eyes, as I<br/>
			Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians<br/>
			Of this most just and merciful of empires.</p>
			<p>Those two that sit above there most enrapture<br/>
			As being very near unto Augusta,<br/>
			Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.</p>
			<p>He who upon the left is near her placed<br/>
			The father is, by whose audacious taste<br/>
			The human species so much bitter tastes.</p>
			<p>Upon the right thou seest that ancient father<br/>
			Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ<br/>
			The keys committed of this lovely flower.</p>
			<p>And he who all the evil days beheld,<br/>
			Before his death, of her the beauteous bride<br/>
			Who with the spear and with the nails was won,</p>
			<p>Beside him sits, and by the other rests<br/>
			That leader under whom on manna lived<br/>
			The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.</p>
			<p>Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,<br/>
			So well content to look upon her daughter,<br/>
			Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.</p>
			<p>And opposite the eldest household father<br/>
			Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<br/>
			When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.</p>
			<p>But since the moments of thy vision fly,<br/>
			Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor<br/>
			Who makes the gown according to his cloth,</p>
			<p>And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,<br/>
			That looking upon Him thou penetrate<br/>
			As far as possible through his effulgence.</p>
			<p>Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,<br/>
			Moving thy wings believing to advance,<br/>
			By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;</p>
			<p>Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;<br/>
			And thou shalt follow me with thy affection<br/>
			That from my words thy heart turn not aside."</p>
			<p>And he began this holy orison.</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 3em">Paradiso: Canto XXXIII</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 2em">"Thou Virgin Mother, daughter of thy Son,<br/>
			Humble and high beyond all other creature,<br/>
			The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,</p>
			<p>Thou art the one who such nobility<br/>
			To human nature gave, that its Creator<br/>
			Did not disdain to make himself its creature.</p>
			<p>Within thy womb rekindled was the love,<br/>
			By heat of which in the eternal peace<br/>
			After such wise this flower has germinated.</p>
			<p>Here unto us thou art a noonday torch<br/>
			Of charity, and below there among mortals<br/>
			Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.</p>
			<p>Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,<br/>
			That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,<br/>
			His aspirations without wings would fly.</p>
			<p>Not only thy benignity gives succour<br/>
			To him who asketh it, but oftentimes<br/>
			Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.</p>
			<p>In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,<br/>
			In thee magnificence; in thee unites<br/>
			Whate'er of goodness is in any creature.</p>
			<p>Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth<br/>
			Of the universe as far as here has seen<br/>
			One after one the spiritual lives,</p>
			<p>Supplicate thee through grace for so much power<br/>
			That with his eyes he may uplift himself<br/>
			Higher towards the uttermost salvation.</p>
			<p>And I, who never burned for my own seeing<br/>
			More than I do for his, all of my prayers<br/>
			Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,</p>
			<p>That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud<br/>
			Of his mortality so with thy prayers,<br/>
			That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.</p>
			<p>Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst<br/>
			Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve<br/>
			After so great a vision his affections.</p>
			<p>Let thy protection conquer human movements;<br/>
			See Beatrice and all the blessed ones<br/>
			My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!"</p>
			<p>The eyes beloved and revered of God,<br/>
			Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us<br/>
			How grateful unto her are prayers devout;</p>
			<p>Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,<br/>
			On which it is not credible could be<br/>
			By any creature bent an eye so clear.</p>
			<p>And I, who to the end of all desires<br/>
			Was now approaching, even as I ought<br/>
			The ardour of desire within me ended.</p>
			<p>Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,<br/>
			That I should upward look; but I already<br/>
			Was of my own accord such as he wished;</p>
			<p>Because my sight, becoming purified,<br/>
			Was entering more and more into the ray<br/>
			Of the High Light which of itself is true.</p>
			<p>From that time forward what I saw was greater<br/>
			Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,<br/>
			And yields the memory unto such excess.</p>
			<p>Even as he is who seeth in a dream,<br/>
			And after dreaming the imprinted passion<br/>
			Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,</p>
			<p>Even such am I, for almost utterly<br/>
			Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet<br/>
			Within my heart the sweetness born of it;</p>
			<p>Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,<br/>
			Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves<br/>
			Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.</p>
			<p>O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee<br/>
			From the conceits of mortals, to my mind<br/>
			Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,</p>
			<p>And make my tongue of so great puissance,<br/>
			That but a single sparkle of thy glory<br/>
			It may bequeath unto the future people;</p>
			<p>For by returning to my memory somewhat,<br/>
			And by a little sounding in these verses,<br/>
			More of thy victory shall be conceived!</p>
			<p>I think the keenness of the living ray<br/>
			Which I endured would have bewildered me,<br/>
			If but mine eyes had been averted from it;</p>
			<p>And I remember that I was more bold<br/>
			On this account to bear, so that I joined<br/>
			My aspect with the Glory Infinite.</p>
			<p>O grace abundant, by which I presumed<br/>
			To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,<br/>
			So that the seeing I consumed therein!</p>
			<p>I saw that in its depth far down is lying<br/>
			Bound up with love together in one volume,<br/>
			What through the universe in leaves is scattered;</p>
			<p>Substance, and accident, and their operations,<br/>
			All interfused together in such wise<br/>
			That what I speak of is one simple light.</p>
			<p>The universal fashion of this knot<br/>
			Methinks I saw, since more abundantly<br/>
			In saying this I feel that I rejoice.</p>
			<p>One moment is more lethargy to me,<br/>
			Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise<br/>
			That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!</p>
			<p>My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,<br/>
			Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,<br/>
			And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.</p>
			<p>In presence of that light one such becomes,<br/>
			That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect<br/>
			It is impossible he e'er consent;</p>
			<p>Because the good, which object is of will,<br/>
			Is gathered all in this, and out of it<br/>
			That is defective which is perfect there.</p>
			<p>Shorter henceforward will my language fall<br/>
			Of what I yet remember, than an infant's<br/>
			Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</p>
			<p>Not because more than one unmingled semblance<br/>
			Was in the living light on which I looked,<br/>
			For it is always what it was before;</p>
			<p>But through the sight, that fortified itself<br/>
			In me by looking, one appearance only<br/>
			To me was ever changing as I changed.</p>
			<p>Within the deep and luminous subsistence<br/>
			Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<br/>
			Of threefold colour and of one dimension,</p>
			<p>And by the second seemed the first reflected<br/>
			As Iris is by Iris, and the third<br/>
			Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.</p>
			<p>O how all speech is feeble and falls short<br/>
			Of my conceit, and this to what I saw<br/>
			Is such, 'tis not enough to call it little!</p>
			<p>O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,<br/>
			Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself<br/>
			And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!</p>
			<p>That circulation, which being thus conceived<br/>
			Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<br/>
			When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,</p>
			<p>Within itself, of its own very colour<br/>
			Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<br/>
			Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.</p>
			<p>As the geometrician, who endeavours<br/>
			To square the circle, and discovers not,<br/>
			By taking thought, the principle he wants,</p>
			<p>Even such was I at that new apparition;<br/>
			I wished to see how the image to the circle<br/>
			Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;</p>
			<p>But my own wings were not enough for this,<br/>
			Had it not been that then my mind there smote<br/>
			A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.</p>
			<p>Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:<br/>
			But now was turning my desire and will,<br/>
			Even as a wheel that equally is moved,</p>
			<p>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.</p>
